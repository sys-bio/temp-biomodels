Robustness, which is an inherent property for cells to maintain homeostasis against a variety of environmental stresses, genetic changes, and stochastic fluctuations, is the key feature to analyze or design the molecular architecture that produces various cellular functions.</p><p>In the field of biotechnology, there have been many studies that aimed at producing useful metabolites using genetically engineered organisms, which often require a rational strategy of how the molecular processes of complex and robust cells are designed in order to achieve enhanced production. Since various mechanisms generating robustness, such as pathway redundancy and feedback (FB) regulation, often cancel the effect of genetic manipulations, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of how a biochemical network generates robustness to genetic perturbations.</p><p>To rationally design biological systems at the molecular interaction level, it is essential to identify a biochemical network map, to build a dynamic model of the system, and to perform system analysis, thereby linking the molecular architecture to cellular functions. Computer-aided design (CAD) is now a key concept in building dynamic models and to mathematically simulate the molecular architecture of a genetically engineered cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Perturbation analysis is useful for identifying critical parameters that affect the system's performance. To modify the metabolism using biotechnology, the most common and convenient methodology for perturbation analysis is changing the copy number of metabolic pathway coding genes by using genetic recombination technology. Most of the previous metabolic engineering studies proposed qualitative alternations of the nature of enzymes or metabolite concentrations in cells.</p><p>Furthermore, module-based analysis has been presented that decomposes a biochemical network map into hierarchical modules, functional and flux modules, in a manner analogous to control engineering architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). If an engineering purpose is provided for a biochemical network, functional modules are readily determined and an engineering function can be assigned to each module. This greatly facilitates the rational design of a genetic manipulation responsible for achieving the desired outcome, and provides an intuitive understanding of how the biochemical network of interest is improved or modified.</p><p>In the field of industrial production of useful substances by microorganisms, glucose (Glc) is one of the most important substrates necessary for substance production or cell growth. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a commonly used microbe in the industrial field, including the manufacture of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Ikeda, 2003</xref>) and organic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wendisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To enhance the ability to utilize substrates is of critical importance to increase the productivity of useful substances from the viewpoint of economical impact. Based on biological knowledge of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), several modeling and simulation studies have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Rohwer <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Thattai and Shraiman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sauter and Gilles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Rohwer <italic>et al</italic> (2000)</xref> measured the kinetic parameters of the <italic>E. coli</italic> glucose PTS and built the enzymatic reaction model. To study catabolite repression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sauter and Gilles (2004)</xref> developed a numerical model describing the transport and signal processing function by the sucrose PTS, validating their model with several experiments.</p><p>To perform perturbation analysis or to analyze the effect of the copy number of genes, we constructed an extended mathematical model of the <italic>E. coli</italic> glucose PTS model including the transcriptional regulation of the PTS proteins. The final objective was to increase the fermentation productivity through genetic improvement of glucose uptake efficiency in the PTS model. We propose a general strategy for computer-aided rational design of biochemical models as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. CAD supports construction of a biochemical network map, mathematical modeling, dynamic simulation, and system analysis. Using the CADLIVE system we designed the molecular architecture of the glucose PTS that consists of the following genes: <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>ptsI</italic>, <italic>crr</italic>, <italic>cyaA</italic>, <italic>crp</italic>, and <italic>mlc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In order to make a rational plan of how the PTS could be genetically engineered for an enhanced glucose uptake rate, or to determine which genes should be deleted or overexpressed, the PTS was decomposed into hierarchical modules, functional and flux modules, in a manner analogous to control engineering architectures, and subsequently the effects of changes in gene expression on the glucose uptake rate were simulated to predict which genes are critical for enhanced uptake. Finally we validated the predicted performance of rationally engineered cells with experimental results, demonstrating the feasibility of the computer-aided rational design of biochemical networks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modular architecture of the glucose PTS and mathematical modeling</title><p>We present a biochemical map of the <italic>E. coli</italic> glucose PTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) and developed a dynamic model from this map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>; see also Materials and methods) by using CADLIVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Details of the graphical notation are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Generally, it is of great importance to increase the sugar uptake rate for enhanced substance production. We aimed at increasing the glucose uptake rate. To assign a particular function to each gene in terms of an enhanced uptake rate, the biochemical map of the glucose PTS was decomposed into functional modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) and flux modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) analogous to an engineering control systems block diagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kurata <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Specifically, if we define the phosphotransfer cascade of IICB<sup>Glc</sup> (<italic>ptsG</italic>), IIA<sup>Glc</sup> (<italic>crr</italic>), HPr (<italic>ptsH</italic>), and EI (<italic>ptsI</italic>) as the plant to be controlled, then the entity that drives this plant is the signal from the accelerator actuator. The phosphorylation signal of IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P is sensed by the FB sensor module and sent to the computer module that consists of adenylate cyclase (CYA), cyclic AMP (cAMP), and cAMP receptor protein (CRP), while it is also transmitted to the signal transduction pathways to enhance other carbon transport systems. The complex of IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P:CYA, which is formed in the FB sensor module, produces the cAMP signal in the computer module, resulting in the formation of CRP:cAMP. CRP:cAMP is the output of the computer module, which modulates the accelerator and brake actuator modules. The accelerator actuator module comprises the synthesis process of the IICB<sup>Glc</sup>, HPr, and EI proteins, supplying these PTS proteins to the plant module; the brake actuator module of the Making Large Colonies Protein (Mlc) suppresses the synthesis of the same PTS proteins.</p><p>Superimposed on these functional modules, we identify two major flux modules, the accelerator flux module and the brake flux module. Although our description of these fluxes is qualitative, the components of the fluxes can be easily identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>. First, we identified the accelerator flux module where the signal of the IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P increase goes through the FB sensor, computer, accelerator actuator, and plant modules to induce the synthesis of IICB<sup>Glc</sup>, HPr, and EI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Second, we identified the brake flux module where the signal of the IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P increase goes through the FB sensor, computer, brake actuator, accelerator actuator, and plant modules, which regulates the PTS component synthesis by suppressing the accelerator actuator.</p><p>We provide an example of the signal processing under glucose depletion conditions. Since the phosphorous of IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P is not transferred to glucose, the IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P concentration immediately increases. The sensor module then assesses an increase in the signal molecule, transmitting its information to the computer module. The computer module calculates the output signal necessary for an adequate control action, which is transmitted simultaneously to the accelerator actuator module and the brake actuator module. The phosphotransfer activity in the plant module is determined by the balance between the accelerator and brake actuator modules.</p><p>The mathematical equations can be connected to the functional modules for the full model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In this model, Equations (1.1&#x02013;1.8) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> describe the plant module, which corresponds to the phosphotransfer reactions in the PTS. Equations (2.1&#x02013;2.3) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> describe the FB sensor module, which senses the extracellular glucose concentration. The computer module corresponds to Equations (3.1&#x02013;3.13), which contains transcription and translation of the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>cyaA</italic> genes and cAMP production. The brake actuator module corresponds to Equations (4.1&#x02013;4.13), which describes the role of the Mlc protein. Equations (5.1&#x02013;5.26) show the accelerator actuator module, which contains the transcription and translation reactions of the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>ptsI</italic>, and <italic>crr</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamic simulation</title><p>To demonstrate how the mathematical model reproduces the dynamic behaviors of the glucose PTS with respect to glucose, we simulated the model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>. These dynamic behaviors were very consistent with the experimental data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, the concentration of IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P rapidly increased just after glucose depletion, while that of IIA<sup>Glc</sup> decreased. Since phosphorus is not transferred to glucose due to its depletion, the phosphorylated proteins accumulate in the plant module. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>, the concentration of cAMP greatly increased in response to glucose depletion and gradually decreased after the peak, then reached a steady-state. The accumulated IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P protein, which is assumed to be the signal for adenylate cyclase activation, binds to adenylate cyclase in the FB sensor module, thereby enhancing the synthesis of cAMP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, the concentration of the complex of Mlc and promoter 1 for the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene increased in response to glucose depletion, which resulted from the decrease in the IICB<sup>Glc</sup> concentration. Consequently, the complex of Mlc and promoter 1 of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene suppresses the gene expression of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene. In the same manner, <italic>ptsH</italic> and <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression was suppressed by the complex of Mlc and promoter 0 of the <italic>ptsH</italic> and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes. If the concentration of IICB<sup>Glc</sup> is high, IICB<sup>Glc</sup> captures Mlc to prevent Mlc from binding to promoter 1 of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene, which permits transcription to proceed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>, the expression of the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes diminished in response to glucose depletion. This suppression was caused mainly by the brake actuator module. Actually, since the effect of the brake actuator module is greater than that of the accelerator actuator module in the absence of glucose, the synthesized Mlc protein suppresses the transcription of the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes. The phosphotransfer activity decreases in the plant module, thereby decreasing glucose uptake. In the PTS, to solve the problem of glucose depletion, the signal of glucose depletion, the accumulated IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P, is transferred to the signal transduction pathways to enhance other carbon transport systems.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Validation of the mathematical model by experimental data</title><p>To further validate the mathematical model, we compared the simulated results with experimental data that were not used for the mathematical modeling, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. Such comparison of the simulated results with experimental data demonstrated that the dynamic behavior of the mathematical model was consistent with that of the experimental data.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, the dynamic model reproduced the experimental behavior that the concentration of intracellular cAMP and CRP:cAMP varied with the extracellular glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Notley-McRobb <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). The cAMP concentration in glucose-abundant medium was lower than that in glucose-deficient medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, the IIA<sup>Glc</sup> protein was dephosphorylated at a high extracellular glucose concentration and the phosphorylation status of IIA<sup>Glc</sup> protein was responsible for the extracellular concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hogema <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). These simulated results were consistent with the experimental data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Zeppenfeld <italic>et al</italic> (2000)</xref> measured the <italic>ptsG</italic> promoter activity in wild type and an <italic>mlc</italic> knockout strain (<italic>mlc</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) using a <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion in minimum medium with glucose and glycerol. In wild-type cells, the <italic>ptsG</italic> promoter activity in glucose medium was higher than that in glycerol medium, which may result from the de-repression of Mlc. In both glycerol and glucose medium, the <italic>ptsG</italic> promoter activity in an <italic>mlc</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> knockout strain was higher than that in wild-type cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>, the expression of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene was successfully reproduced by the simulation, where the glucose dose dependency for <italic>ptsG</italic> gene expression was observed both in wild type and an <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant and the gene expression level in the <italic>mlc</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant was higher than that in wild-type cells regardless of the extracellular glucose concentration.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Extraction of critical genes for enhanced glucose uptake</title><p>The functional and flux module decomposition of the PTS model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) readily provides a rational strategy for enhanced glucose uptake. The <italic>mlc</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> genes of the transcription regulation factors affect the expression of multiple genes. The <italic>mlc</italic> gene is responsible for the brake actuator, thus <italic>mlc</italic> knockout is expected to enhance the synthesis of the PTS proteins. The <italic>crp</italic> gene belongs to the computer module for the accelerator actuator, and thus overexpression of the <italic>crp</italic> gene has a potential to enhance the synthesis of the PTS proteins. Since the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>ptsI</italic>, and <italic>crr</italic> genes are the catalysts for the phosphorylation cascade in the plant module, it is reasonable to increase their expression for enhanced glucose uptake rates. It is critical for enhanced glucose uptake to increase the PTS proteins in the plant module (the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>ptsI</italic>, and <italic>crr</italic> genes), to delete the brake actuator module (the <italic>mlc</italic> gene), or to enhance the accelerator actuator module through the computer module (the <italic>crp</italic> gene). Regarding the <italic>crp</italic> gene manipulation it is necessary to consider the quantitative balance between the accelerator and brake flux modules, because CRP:cAMP not only enhances the accelerator actuator but also the brake actuator.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Simulation and perturbation analysis of the rationally designed PTS</title><p>To further explore target genes critically responsible for enhancing glucose uptake, we performed perturbation analysis with regard to <italic>crp</italic>, <italic>mlc</italic>, <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>ptsI</italic>, and <italic>crr</italic> gene expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>, where the specific glucose uptake rates were simulated with respect to a 10-fold change in the copy number of these genes. When the concentration of a target gene was varied by 10-fold from the default condition (wild type), the ratio of the specific glucose uptake rate for a mathematical mutant to that for the wild type was simulated. The ratio of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentration to the pyruvate (Pyr) concentration ([PEP]/[Pyr]) was set to 1 and each concentration was set to 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chassagnole <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). We calculated the effect of the <italic>mlc</italic> gene disruption and <italic>crp</italic> gene amplification (<italic>crp</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) on the specific glucose uptake rate. The <italic>ptsI</italic> gene amplification showed the most enhanced specific glucose uptake rate for all the strains: wild type, the <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant, and the <italic>crp</italic>-overexpressing mutant. An <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant that overexpressed the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes was predicted to enhance the specific glucose uptake rate by the greatest degree. Since the ratio of the intracellular PEP to the Pyr concentration affected the specific glucose uptake rate by the PTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hogema <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), we simulated the <italic>ptsI</italic> amplification effect on an enhanced specific glucose uptake rate using various values of the ratio of [PEP]/[Pyr], by changing each molecule concentration from 0.1 to 10 mM and confirmed that <italic>ptsI</italic> amplification was always effective in enhancing the glucose uptake (data not shown). Based on this result, the subsequent simulations were performed with 1:1 ratio at 1 mM of PEP and Pyr concentration.</p><p>To analyze the mechanism of how the glucose uptake rate is increased by <italic>ptsI</italic> gene amplification, the PTS component concentrations were simulated with respect to a change in the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene dose, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>. Since the specific glucose uptake rate is defined as the rate of the phosphotransfer reaction from phosphorylated IICB<sup>Glc</sup> to glucose per cell, that is, the production rate of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), the glucose uptake rate is closely related to that for the phosphorylated status of IICB<sup>Glc</sup> protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A&#x02013;D</xref>, the concentrations of phosphorylated proteins increased with an increase in the concentration of the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene. This simulated result suggests that the increase in the PTS flux is caused by an increase in the EI protein concentration. In the simulation, the phosphorylated IIA<sup>Glc</sup> protein becomes abundant when the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene is 10-fold amplified compared with the default condition. The phosphorylation status of the IIA<sup>Glc</sup> protein is known to depend on extracellular sugars and most of the IIA<sup>Glc</sup> proteins are unphosphorylated when glucose is used in the medium. The phosphorylation of the IIA<sup>Glc</sup> protein is suggested to be the signal for increasing the activity of adenylate cyclase that converts ATP into cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hogema <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E and F</xref>, the specific glucose uptake rate and the intracellular cAMP and CRP:cAMP complex concentrations increased with an increase in the EI concentration. The increase in the CRP:cAMP concentration activates the transcription of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene and <italic>pts</italic> operon, subsequently increasing the specific glucose uptake rate.</p><p>Out of the <italic>ptsG</italic>, <italic>ptsH</italic>, <italic>crr</italic>, and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes, the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene was selected for detailed analysis because its amplification enhanced the specific glucose uptake rate most strongly. In addition, some background information supports this selection. The <italic>ptsI</italic> gene encodes the EI protein, which catalyzes the phosphate transfer reaction from PEP to the EI protein. This reaction is suggested to be a rate-limiting step for glucose uptake in the PTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Weigel <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Patel <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and the enhanced EI protein concentration is expected to lead to an increase in the glucose PTS flux. The transcriptional attenuation of <italic>ptsH</italic> and <italic>ptsI</italic> occurs and the amount of <italic>ptsI</italic> transcripts is suggested to be one-tenth of that of the <italic>ptsH</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">De Reuse and Danchin, 1988</xref>). Supposedly, the attenuation of the <italic>ptsI</italic> transcript is one of the intrinsic points governing the glucose PTS flux. Therefore, the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene was a reasonable choice among the enzymes of the phosphorylation cascade in the plant module.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental validation of rationally designed cells</title><p>The <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant that overexpresses both the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>ptsI</italic> genes was predicted to enhance the specific glucose uptake rate most strongly. To evaluate the validity of the presented strategy, we carried out biological experiments. Since CRP is one of the global regulators whose functions are not fully clear, unexpected effects may be caused by <italic>crp</italic> gene amplification. Thus, we excluded <italic>crp</italic>-overexpressing mutants.</p><p>First, we investigated the effect of <italic>ptsI</italic> gene amplification. The simulation results suggest that more than 10 copies of the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene are required for the enhancement of specific glucose uptake; thus, a high-copy number plasmid was used for <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression. The enhancement of EI protein expression was confirmed by SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To test our prediction on the <italic>ptsI</italic>-amplified strain, MG1655/pUC118-<italic>ptsI</italic>, and a control strain, MG1655/pUC118, were cultivated in 20 ml of M9 glucose medium in a shaking incubator for 18 h. Growth, glucose uptake, specific glucose uptake, and extracellular cAMP concentration were measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>). Regardless of the similar growth of both strains, the specific glucose uptake rate of the <italic>ptsI</italic>-amplified strain was significantly higher than that of the control strain. These experimental findings supported the prediction that an increased EI protein concentration enhances the specific glucose uptake rate under normal cell growth conditions.</p><p>Second, we compared the specific glucose uptake rate between the <italic>ptsI</italic>-overexpressing strain and a control, using non-growing cells in minimum medium without thiamine required for JM109 growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). The specific glucose uptake rate of the <italic>ptsI</italic>-amplified strain, JM109/pUC118-<italic>ptsI</italic>, was higher than that of the control strain, JM109/pUC118. The observed growth (&#x00394;OD<sub>600</sub>) was less than 0.6 in both strains. Mainly, the incorporated glucose was converted into acetic acid or other organic acids (data not shown). This result indicates that the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene amplification enhances the specific glucose uptake rate. This is also supported by previous kinetic studies that the EI protein concentration is critical for increasing the phosphate flux in the PTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Weigel <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Patel <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Third, we examined the effect of how <italic>ptsI</italic> gene amplification in the <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant derived from MG1655 (MG1655M) enhances the specific glucose uptake rate. The <italic>ptsI</italic> amplification strain, MG1655M/pUC118-<italic>ptsI</italic>, and a control strain, MG1655M/pUC118, were cultured in 20 ml of M9 glucose medium in a shaking incubator for 18 h.

The strategy consists of constructing a biochemical network, dynamic simulation, module-based analysis, perturbation analysis, and experimental validation. CAD supports construction of a biochemical network map, building its dynamic model, and system analysis. Module-based analysis decomposes a biochemical network map into hierarchical modules, functional and flux modules, in a manner analogous to control engineering architectures. If an engineering purpose is determined, functional modules are readily determined and an engineering function is assigned to each module. This facilitates rational design of a genetic manipulation responsible for achieving the purpose and an intuitive understanding of how the biochemical network of interest can be improved or modified. Perturbation analysis further explores critical genes responsible for achieving the engineering purpose.</p><p>Using CADLIVE we performed mathematical modeling, simulation, and system analysis to make a strategy of how the glucose PTS can be genetically engineered for enhanced glucose uptake. We found the critical factors responsible for an enhanced specific glucose uptake rate, for example, <italic>ptsI</italic> amplification and <italic>mlc</italic> knockout. Mathematical simulation and subsequent perturbation analysis predicted that the combination of amplification of <italic>ptsI</italic> and deletion of <italic>mlc</italic> would enhance the specific glucose uptake rate. Finally, experimental data validated this prediction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rational design of a robust system</title><p>Rational design requires an understanding of the mechanism of how a biochemical network provides a robust property to a target performance, or identifying the genes that show fragility of the performance to their genetic change. Manipulation for a particular flux module has a great potential to change the network performance of interest, for example, deletion of a negative FB loop or enhancement of a positive FB loop readily alters the cellular performance. In the glucose PTS, the brake actuator flux module has a negative FB loop. An increase in <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression enhances phosphorylation of the PTS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P:CYA binding, CRP:cAMP synthesis, and Mlc production in turn, thereby suppressing <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression. By contrast, the accelerator actuator flux module has a positive FB loop. An increase in <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression enhances phosphorylation of the PTS proteins, IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P:CYA binding, and CRP:cAMP synthesis in turn, which further enhances <italic>ptsI</italic> gene expression. Genetic manipulation for such a negative or positive FB loop shows a great potential to enhance the specific glucose uptake or activation of the PTS proteins. Knockout of the <italic>mlc</italic> gene is reasonable for <italic>ptsI</italic> gene overexpression, because it removes the negative FB loop that suppresses EI protein expression. Perturbation analysis in both the mathematical model and biological experiment support this design strategy.</p><p>In the improved model, positive and negative FBs were cancelled by disabling the function that IIA<sup>Glc</sup>-P:CYA synthesizes cAMP, where the glucose PTS system forms a more straight forward network. The brake flux module without the negative FB shows less suppression of PTS proteins with respect to EI or HPr overexpression, and the accelerator flux module without the positive FB weakens the expression of them. Actually, the specific glucose rate would be determined through the quantitative balance between the brake and accelerator modules. In the improved model, the decrease in the specific glucose uptake rate for <italic>ptsI</italic> or <italic>ptsH</italic> overexpression for wild type and an <italic>mlc</italic> knockout mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">III</xref>) would be due to deletion of the positive FB loop, while the increased uptake rates for other mutants would be caused by removal of the negative FB loop. It is of critical importance for rational design to understand the quantitative mechanism of how a flux module provides robustness to genetic changes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Toward a perfect design</title><p>The simulation results did not necessarily explain the experimental results. As mentioned above, there was a discrepancy in the change in the cAMP concentration between the mathematical and experimental models. The combination of <italic>ptsI</italic> amplification and <italic>mlc</italic> deficiency was predicted to be a better strategy for enhanced specific glucose uptake, but it led to severe growth inhibition. From the mathematical simulation of specific glucose uptake, the <italic>ptsI</italic> gene-overexpressing strain was predicted to have a ratio of 3.87 compared with control, but experimentally at best a ratio of 1.2 (0.018/0.015) was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Tables II</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">III</xref>). Likewise, the ratio for the <italic>mlc</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> background was 5.70, but experimentally 1.7 (0.026/0.015) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Tables II</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">III</xref>). These differences seem to be due to the insufficient model size or lack of various FB regulations of enzyme and gene expressions that provide robustness to genetic modifications in the actual cells. In addition the other proteins, mannose PTS and non-PTS transporter, GalP, which are involved in permeation of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis and Epstein, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hernandez-Montalvo <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), may affect the experimental results.</p><p>The PEP/Pyr ratio is determined as a result of many enzymatic reactions including glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, and anaplerotic pathways. Since growth is the output of complex interactions of a variety of molecules, it is still hard to accurately predict cell growth at the molecular interaction level. A large and complex model would be necessary that includes various regulations of enzyme and gene expressions in the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and anaplerotic pathway. An extended model is expected to clearly describe the experimental results.</p><p>If some discrepancies are found between the mathematical and experimental models, we need to feed this information back into model improvement. Ideally we should iterate the process consisting of mathematical analysis and experimental validation until prediction agrees with experimental results completely. This iteration cycle is key to the rational design of biochemical systems.</p><p>In conclusion, a computer-aided rational design approach was successfully applied to microbe engineering or breeding and verified by biological experiments. This methodology will lead to rapid development for not only applied biology that designs biochemical networks within a cell, but also fundamental research that reveals the mechanism of how biochemical networks generate particular cellular functions.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Computer-aided rational design of biochemical networks</title><p>CAD is widely defined as computer-based tools that assist engineers, architects, and other design professionals in their design activities.

The concept of CAD can be applied to biochemical systems, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. CAD supports not only constructing biochemical network maps but also mathematical modeling, simulation, and system analysis. To rationally design a biochemical network, it is important to present an engineering purpose and to decompose it into hierarchical functional and flux modules according to the purpose. In a manner analogous to control engineering architecture, a particular function is assigned to each functional module and mathematical simulation with perturbation analysis explores the genes critically responsible for achieving the purpose. These algorithms present a promising strategy for rational design of biochemical networks, providing instruction or prediction of how genes should be modified or manipulated. To validate the prediction, biological experiments are required. If there is any difference between the prediction and the experiment results, biochemical networks need to be redesigned through an understanding of the mechanisms that cause such discrepancies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biological model</title><p>The PTS transports sugars from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, coupled with phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Postma <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>).

To provide a useful characterization of modularity, a multi-resolution scheme can then be used to assess different aspects of the modular decomposition, zooming out from the molecular description (molecular modules) to a block diagram-like picture (functional modules). At a lower level of resolution, the components of a system can be divided into functional groups that we refer to as functional modules. We sought analogies with the modules that are traditionally identified in control engineering schemes. The process to be controlled is identified and the rest of the network is classified in terms of the function that it accomplishes to facilitate this regulation. A block represents each of these modules and the interconnection of such blocks is frequently referred to as a block diagram. We define a flux module as a pathway that traces the mechanisms of interaction of a group of molecules involved together in the performance of a certain function. A flux module ideally connects functional modules, but forms an entity that possesses its own functionality.
