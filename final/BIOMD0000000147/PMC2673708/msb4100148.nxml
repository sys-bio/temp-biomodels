However, disease-associated aberrant activity of the pathway is often due to misregulation of the equilibrium state. The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is typically described as being held inactive in the cytoplasm by binding its inhibitor, I&#x003ba;B, until an external stimulus triggers I&#x003ba;B degradation through an I&#x003ba;B kinase-dependent degradation pathway. Combining genetic, biochemical, and computational tools, we investigate steady-state regulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module and its impact on stimulus responsiveness. We present newly measured <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation rate constants for NF-&#x003ba;B-bound and -unbound I&#x003ba;B proteins that are critical for accurate computational predictions of steady-state I&#x003ba;B protein levels and basal NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Simulations reveal a homeostatic NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module in which differential degradation rates of free and bound pools of I&#x003ba;B represent a novel cross-regulation mechanism that imparts functional robustness to the signaling module.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cross-regulation</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>mathematical modeling</kwd><kwd>robustness</kwd><kwd>signaling module</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular signal transduction pathways mediate responses to extracellular and intracellular signals, such as changing environmental and metabolic conditions, pathogen assault, and developmental cues. Many signaling pathways control the activity of transcription factors that regulate cognate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brivanlou and Darnell, 2002</xref>). For immediate early transcriptional responses (not requiring induced synthesis), such regulation may involve the reversible phosphorylation of the transcription factor to induce dimerization or nuclear translocation (e.g. the Stat, IRF, AP-1 transcription factor families). An alternate means of pathway activation involves stabilization of the transcriptional effector, as in the case of the genotoxic response regulator p53, the hypoxia response factor HIF-1&#x003b1;, or the developmentally regulated coactivator &#x003b2;-catenin. Thus, signaling in response to stimulus involves alterations of the homeostatic rates of synthesis and degradation found in unstimulated cells.</p><p>In contrast, the cellular abundance of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B does not change dramatically during signaling. NF-&#x003ba;B is the critical mediator of cellular responses to a large number of physiological stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, developmental signals, pathogens, and cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006</xref>). Although inflammatory signaling leads to transient NF-&#x003ba;B activity that is dynamically regulated by feedback mechanisms, elevated constitutive levels of active NF-&#x003ba;B are associated with chronic inflammatory diseases and many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Karin, 2006</xref>).</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B activity is inhibited by association with the inhibitor proteins, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;, or I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;, which mask its nuclear localization sequence and inhibit its DNA-binding activity. The regulated metabolism of I&#x003ba;B proteins&#x02014;their synthesis and degradation&#x02014;critically controls NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Synthesis of I&#x003ba;B proteins is a highly regulated process, with at least two isoforms, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;, being subject to NF-&#x003ba;B-inducible synthesis, thereby providing negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kearns <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Stimulus-induced I&#x003ba;B degradation is controlled by the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates two N-terminal serines. This leads to I&#x003ba;B polyubiquitination and degradation via the 26S proteasome, thus liberating NF-&#x003ba;B for nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Yaron <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>These processes were described in a mathematical model of the IKK-I&#x003ba;B-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module to recapitulate NF-&#x003ba;B activation in response to TNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Its construction relied on rate constants available in the literature from a diverse set of experiments. As no isoform-specific data were available, rate constants pertaining to I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; and I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; were assumed to be the same as those measured for I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Although this model accurately recapitulates NF-&#x003ba;B signaling in response to TNF, in the unstimulated state the estimated I&#x003ba;B levels were found to be unexpectedly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Lipniacki <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In fact, the vast majority of I&#x003ba;B were calculated to be in the free form, contradictory to experimental studies showing that free I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; accounts for less than 15&#x00025; of the total cellular I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Rice and Ernst, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Despite our detailed understanding of stimulus-induced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, there is less clarity about the mechanisms mediating I&#x003ba;B turnover in the absence of external stimulation. Early studies reported that basal turnover of I&#x003ba;B, unlike its induced degradation, does not require the IKK-targeted serines, the C-terminal PEST domain, or poly-ubiquitination of I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Krappmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), whereas others found robust C-terminal phosphorylation and poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Pando and Verma, 2000</xref>).</p><p>By distinguishing between NF-&#x003ba;B-bound and free I&#x003ba;B pools using an I&#x003ba;B interaction mutant, the half-life of bound I&#x003ba;B was found to be five-fold longer than that of free I&#x003ba;B in unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Pando and Verma, 2000</xref>). However, free I&#x003ba;B is a poorer substrate for IKK than NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Zandi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), although it is routinely used as a substrate to measure IKK activity <italic>in vitro.</italic> Free I&#x003ba;B turnover was proposed to involve casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bren <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), but others suggested that CK2 is involved in inducible degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Kato <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), or that ubiquitination was not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Krappmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alvarez-Castelao and Castano, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Given these contradictory results in the literature, the lack of data on two of the three I&#x003ba;B isoforms, and the poor fit of computational simulations of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module in cells not exposed to TNF, we generated genetic tools&#x02014;mouse knockout cell lines&#x02014;to isolate cleanly the endogenous-free and -bound I&#x003ba;B protein pools and probe their degradation with kinase knockouts and pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, we used computational modeling (i) to identify which constitutive degradation rate constants play a critical role in determining stimulus responsiveness, (ii) to determine new biochemical rate constants based on our experimental results, (iii) to confirm the validity of the new parameters by simulating the cellular steady state, and (iv) to reveal the control of I&#x003ba;B degradation by NF-&#x003ba;B as a cross-regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>IKK-dependent and -independent degradation of I&#x003ba;Bs determine NF-&#x003ba;B signaling</title><p>Four degradation rate constants govern the <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of I&#x003ba;B proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). An I&#x003ba;B molecule can exist in either the free or NF-&#x003ba;B-bound form. Both forms may be degraded in an IKK-dependent manner (we denote the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; rate constants of these processes r1 and r4, respectively), but are also subject to constitutive degradation in an IKK-independent manner (with the rate constants denoted as deg1 and deg4). These mechanisms are described as first-order rate constants in our mathematical model of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>To explore the functional significance of each I&#x003ba;B degradation rate constant in NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction, we performed simulations of TNF signaling after altering one of the four rate constants (simultaneously for the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x0025b; isoforms) with a parameter multiplier ranging from 0.01 to 100. For each parameter multiplier, we calculated the average nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B level in response to TNF during the early phase (during the first hour of stimulation) and the later attenuation phase (during the second hour after a 4 h stimulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). By plotting the calculated NF-&#x003ba;B activity against its parameter multiplier, we can interpret the sensitivity of the system to each rate constant for two critical features of the NF-&#x003ba;B response to a transient TNF stimulus: activation and attenuation of NF-&#x003ba;B activity.</p><p>We first examined the impact of changes in IKK-dependent I&#x003ba;B degradation rate constants on NF-&#x003ba;B activation. During the first hour of TNF stimulation, the amount of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B calculated by the model is fairly insensitive to even drastic changes in the IKK-dependent degradation rate of free I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue line). In contrast, slowing down the IKK-induced degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B severely dampens NF-&#x003ba;B activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, red line). During the attenuation phase, the amount of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B predicted by the model was similarly found to be insensitive to changes in IKK-dependent degradation of free I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>, blue line), but slowing the IKK-dependent degradation rate of bound I&#x003ba;B results in a loss of attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>, red line).</p><p>The IKK-independent I&#x003ba;B degradation rates control the stimulus-independent turnover of I&#x003ba;B proteins, and thus maintain a resting state equilibrium of I&#x003ba;B levels. Examining whether these IKK-independent degradation rates play a role in determining the cellular responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli revealed that during the first hour of TNF stimulation the signaling module is dramatically more sensitive to the basal turnover rate of free I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>, blue line) than of bound I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>, red line). Furthermore, our simulations predicted that a more stable free I&#x003ba;B results in a loss of attenuation, whereas the basal turnover rate of the bound I&#x003ba;Bs had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>In sum, our computational simulations revealed that two of the four possible degradation pathways play a particularly important role in controlling NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. Whereas much is known about the stimulus-responsive IKK-mediated degradation pathway, the IKK-independent degradation mechanism of free I&#x003ba;B has received surprisingly little experimental attention. Given the importance of these degradation rate constants in our computational analysis, we set out to examine them in more detail experimentally.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NF-&#x003ba;B regulation of I&#x003ba;B protein turnover and synthesis</title><p>To measure experimentally <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation rate constants for NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B proteins, we used the ribosomal inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to reduce the synthesis of new I&#x003ba;B proteins (by 85&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), and examined the amount of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity via electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Treatment of wild-type MEFs with CHX over a 60 h time course induced nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B activity that corresponds to 25&#x02013;35&#x00025; of peak TNF-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). To determine the relative contributions of each NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B isoform (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x0025b;) to CHX-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we used a panel of I&#x003ba;B double-knockout MEFs, which contain only one I&#x003ba;B isoform. These cells were previously used to determine the degradation rate constants for each I&#x003ba;B isoform by TNF-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which revealed that upon IKK activation, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was degraded most rapidly, followed by I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;, and then I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, we find the same trend in stimulus-independent degradation, where I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; is the most stable and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is the least stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the stability of the unbound, or &#x02018;free', I&#x003ba;B proteins in resting cells, we generated <italic>crel</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>rela</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>nfkb1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> (termed &#x02018;<italic>nfkb</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>') MEFs deficient in the three NF-&#x003ba;B proteins known to interact with the classical I&#x003ba;B proteins: RelA, c-Rel, and p50. Western blots revealed a dramatic reduction in the amount of total I&#x003ba;B protein level in these cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 6).

No decrease in I&#x003ba;B levels was detected in MEFs deficient in the NF-&#x003ba;B proteins RelB and <italic>nf&#x003ba;b2</italic> p52, which are non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B proteins that do not bind canonical I&#x003ba;B proteins.</p><p>Strikingly, the level of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mRNA in the <italic>nfkb</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells was only two-fold lower than in wild type, with even smaller differences in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; and I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), suggesting that differential protein stability may account for different I&#x003ba;B protein levels in wild-type and <italic>nfkb</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells.

These results suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B has a regulatory role not only in controlling I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; transcription, but also in stabilizing I&#x003ba;B proteins.</p><p>We next investigated whether the dramatically different half-life of free and bound I&#x003ba;B proteins may be due to different mechanisms governing their degradation.</p><p>IKK phosphorylation is a key mediator of the stimulus-induced degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B proteins, yet it is unclear if and how IKK may participate in the basal degradation of bound I&#x003ba;B. We first performed a kinase assay to examine the IKK activity of immunoprecipitated IKK complex from wild-type MEFs. Surprisingly, even in resting cells, a substantial amount of basal activity associated with the IKK complex was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). In cells lacking the IKK catalytic subunits, IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;, no activation of NF-&#x003ba;B upon CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>) was observed, indicating that IKK-dependent phosphorylation is required for the basal turnover of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B proteins.</p><p>We sought to determine if IKK activity is involved in the turnover of free I&#x003ba;B proteins as well.

Further, the IKK inhibitor, sc-514, which diminishes the TNF-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in wild-type cells, did not have an effect on the basal turnover of free I&#x003ba;B in <italic>nfkb</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented not only TNF-induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in wild-type cells, but also led to accumulation of free I&#x003ba;B in <italic>nfkb</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells, and prevented its degradation when cells were cotreated with CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Based on our new biochemical data, we revised the parameter values governing degradation of I&#x003ba;B proteins within the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module and incorporated these into our mathematical model (now termed model 1.1).

While previous studies suggested that NF-&#x003ba;B stabilized free I&#x003ba;B degradation by a factor of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Pando and Verma, 2000</xref>), our new measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>) indicate an NF-&#x003ba;B effect of 2000-fold with respect to the IKK-independent degradation of I&#x003ba;B proteins. This large discrepancy likely lies in the facts that (i) we have used a clean genetic system to isolate free endogenous I&#x003ba;B from NF-&#x003ba;B proteins, and have thus obtained a much faster degradation rate for free I&#x003ba;B and (ii) we have determined that degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B proteins can only occur through an IKK-involving mechanism and have thus drastically decreased the IKK-independent degradation rate of bound I&#x003ba;B.</p><p>After incorporation of the new rate constants in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>, we performed model fitting as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) to obtain new degradation rate constants for IKK-induced degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B-bound I&#x003ba;B proteins (r4-6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table SI</xref>). As IKK-mediated phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B is five-fold more efficient when NF-&#x003ba;B is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Zandi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), we divided the newly determined r4-6 by 5 to determine IKK-induced degradation of free I&#x003ba;B proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table SI</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> for rate constant derivations). Including eight-fold differential IKK association rate constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Zandi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), the combined NF-&#x003ba;B effect on IKK-mediated degradation of free and bound I&#x003ba;B proteins is almost 50-fold.</p><p>Our results emphasize that NF-&#x003ba;B determines the degradation mechanism of I&#x003ba;B proteins. When bound to NF-&#x003ba;B, I&#x003ba;B turnover is slow and dependent on the basal activity of IKK. In contrast, when not bound to NF-&#x003ba;B, I&#x003ba;B degradation is rapid and independent of IKK activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cross-regulation between I&#x003ba;B proteins via half-life control by NF-&#x003ba;B</title><p>We compared the steady-state levels of I&#x003ba;B predicted for unstimulated cells by the previous version of the model (referred to as model 1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and the new version of the model that incorporates the new rate constants of <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref> (model 1.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, white and gray bars, respectively). The new degradation rate constants result in predictions of a much smaller pool of free I&#x003ba;B protein, as well as less total cellular I&#x003ba;B protein. The simulation results produced with the new model (1.1) are therefore in much better agreement with experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Rice and Ernst, 1993</xref>) than those with the previous model. Although a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Lipniacki <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) lowered the I&#x003ba;B synthesis rate to correct the model-predicted ratio of free to bound I&#x003ba;B protein in the steady state, our new data indicate that the rapid free I&#x003ba;B degradation necessitates a high synthesis rate.</p><p>Next, we examined the consequences of the new degradation parameters on constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activity in a series of I&#x003ba;B knockout cell lines. The previous model predicts that the removal of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; results in high levels of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B activity in unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>), which does not match with our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). The differential degradation rates of bound and unbound I&#x003ba;B protein may result in molecular compensation among the I&#x003ba;B isoforms; upon deletion of a single I&#x003ba;B isoform, the newly available NF-&#x003ba;B may act to stabilize the remaining I&#x003ba;B isoforms, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of NF-&#x003ba;B. Indeed, model 1.1 predicts a lower level of NF-&#x003ba;B activity in unstimulated knockout cells than version 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>, compare white and gray bars). EMSA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>) confirm the new predictions, indicating that functional I&#x003ba;B compensation via differential half-life control indeed exists.</p><p>In the case of <italic>i&#x003ba;b</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells where I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; is the only isoform present, our model predicts a markedly higher level of NF-&#x003ba;B activity than seen experimentally. However, we have recently characterized an NF-&#x003ba;B-inducible I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; mRNA synthesis mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kearns <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Incorporation of this feedback mechanism into the model (referred to as model 1.2) indeed lowers the predicted basal NF-&#x003ba;B levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>, black bars) to levels that are in good agreement with the EMSA results. We measured I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; mRNA levels and found that they are indeed upregulated in <italic>i</italic>&#x003ba;<italic>b</italic>&#x003b1;<sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>), resulting in higher I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>). To determine whether this effect was the result of homeostatic regulation within the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module, we used a retroviral transgene to reconstitute I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; expression in <italic>i</italic>&#x003ba;<italic>b</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Indeed, we found that I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; upregulation was reversible, confirming that even in resting cells constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activity plays a role in transcriptional regulation of its inhibitors to controls its own steady-state activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Homeostatic control via distinct I&#x003ba;B degradation pathways</title><p>Our analysis of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module in unstimulated cells reveals a highly dynamic homeostatic state that is controlled by multiple synthesis and degradation mechanisms of the regulatory I&#x003ba;B proteins. As such we find that NF-&#x003ba;B itself has two roles in regulating its own basal activity. NF-&#x003ba;B binding to I&#x003ba;B proteins removes them from this rapid degradation pathway, and sensitizes them to a slow degradation mechanism that is dependent on basal IKK activity. Second, constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activity also impacts transcription rates of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;, thus providing for negative feedback even in the absence of an external stimulus.</p><p>Our studies identify the free I&#x003ba;B protein degradation pathway as a major determinant of constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B and of stimulus responsiveness of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module. Given this hitherto unappreciated importance, determining the enzymatic and potentially regulatory mechanisms of the free I&#x003ba;B degradation pathway is critical for understanding the regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B in diverse physiological and pathological settings.</p><p>Owing to the dynamic nature of the I&#x003ba;B-NF-&#x003ba;B equilibrium, the majority of newly synthesized I&#x003ba;B is likely degraded before ever binding NF-&#x003ba;B. However, this is not unlike other signal transduction pathways that consume significant cellular resources for the maintenance of a dynamic homeostatic state. For example, the transcription factors p53, HIF-1&#x003b1;, and &#x003b2;-catenin are continually synthesized and degraded. Upon signaling, the respective degradation pathways are inhibited to allow for their nuclear accumulation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Ivan <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Jaakkola <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Moon, 2005</xref>). How may this energy-consuming process of maintaining a dynamic homeostasis benefit the cell? Future computational studies may suggest that homeostatic control of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling module confers sensitivity to signals but ensures a very steady low equilibrium activity that is less likely to drift (D Barken, unpublished results). In addition, combined computational and experimental studies may demonstrate that such a dynamic equilibrium state sensitizes the signaling pathway to metabolic changes, such that stress conditions constitute an input signal that results in cellular responses (Ellen L O'Dea, unpublished results).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Primary and 3T3 immortalized MEF were generated from E12.5&#x02013;14.5 embryos and maintained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). <italic>rela</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>crel</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>nfkb1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MEFs were generated from E12.5-timed matings of <italic>rela</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>crel</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>nfkb1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice and <italic>i</italic>&#x003ba;<italic>b</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x0025b;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells will be described elsewhere. <italic>ikk1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup><italic>ikk2</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells were a kind gift from Inder Verma. <italic>i</italic>&#x003ba;<italic>b</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF lines reconstituted with pBabe-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and empty vector control were a generous gift from Erika Mathes.
