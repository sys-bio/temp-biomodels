As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>We applied a systems modelling approach combining mechanistic modelling and biological experimentation to identify effective drug combinations for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with no approved targeted treatment.

Consequently, combination therapy has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to circumvent drug resistance and thus is being actively pursued in many cancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Yet, we face daunting challenges of how to predict the best combinations of targets and importantly, how to prioritize those combinations for clinical testing. Given the number of possible target combinations are vast but clinical trials are slow and expensive, there is an urgent need to develop rational and unbiased approaches to predict effective drug combinations, prioritize them and stratify patients for optimal benefit.</p><p>Analysis of the activity and dynamics of signalling networks should aid in the development of effective combination therapies against oncogenic kinases [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, signalling networks often contain complex pathway crosstalk and feedback regulation, making it difficult to analyse the drug-induced network behaviours and emergent network features using experimental approaches alone [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Instead, experimentally-grounded mathematical models of signalling networks that integrate pathway crosstalk and feedback loops provide a powerful quantitative framework for the systematic analysis of network-level dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As feedback loops often lead to unexpected adverse effects of drug treatments, these models have the power to predict effective and non-trivial combination treatments in cancer cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Here, we employ a systems-based approach combining mechanistic modelling and biological experiments to predict and prioritize drug combinations for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer.</p><p>While targeted therapies have vastly improved the survival of ER/PR-(Estrogen/Progesterone receptor) and HER2/ErbB2-positive breast cancers, TNBC, which is defined by the absence of these hormone receptors and of HER2 amplification [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], remains a major clinical challenge with no efficient targeted therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. TNBC comprises an heterogeneous group of cancers with at least six molecular subtypes (BL1: basal-like 1, BL2: basal-like 2, IM: immunomodulatory, M: mesenchymal, MSL: mesenchymal stem-like, and LAR: luminal androgen receptor), which display different clinico-pathological features and divergent responses to treatments [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This heterogeneity requires efficient patient stratification strategies, capable of predictively selecting most suitable patients for specific treatments, while excluding the unsuitable individuals or subgroups.</p><p>Several signalling pathways, including the PI3K/mTOR pathway, JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf as well as the EGFR and c-Met pathways have been considered as potential therapeutic targets for TNBC [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Tyrosine Receptor Kinases EGFR and c-Met are highly expressed in TNBC and implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, their targeting by monotherapeutic agents has a marginal clinical efficacy possibly due to bidirectional compensatory responses, activation of alternative pathway(s), and/or other resistance mechanisms [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. EGFR and c-Met share overlapping downstream signalling pathways and can trans-phosphorylate one another. We have recently found that PYK2 is a common downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met; and have delineated their crosstalk signalling in TNBC, demonstrating that knockdown of PYK2 facilitates receptor degradation and concomitantly inhibits EGF-induced ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. PYK2 positively regulates STAT3-phosphorylation in response to EGFR activation, while pSTAT3 binds to the PYK2 promoter and enhances PYK2 transcription, and indirectly upregulates c-Met expression [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These results suggest a number of positive-feedback loops between PYK2, STAT3, c-Met and EGFR, and imply that co-targeting of components of this circuit could have therapeutic impact.</p><p>Here, we develop and experimentally validate a quantitative mechanistic model of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network and demonstrate the utility of this model in accurately predicting and importantly, prioritizing synergistic drug combinations for TNBC. Notably, model predictions supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data reveal co-inhibition of EGFR-PYK2 and EGFR-c-MET yield the most synergistic effects among other possible drug combinations. Moreover, integrated modelling-experimental analysis uncovers switch-like response to single-drug inhibition at both the signalling (STAT3 and ERK activation) and cell proliferation levels, and establish a link between these switches and the drug synergy displayed by the combination treatment. Excitingly, simulations of patient-specific models generated through incorporating gene expression data from individual TNBC patients led to stratification of patients into subgroups with distinct susceptibility to EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition, thereby predicting a subset of highly susceptible patient characterized by high PYK2 expression. Collectively, we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the power of quantitative mechanistic modelling in the rational discovery and prioritization of effective drug combinations for TNBC. Importantly, the principles contained in this work are highly applicable to other signalling systems and/or tumour types, which should significantly aid in the selection of best target combinations for further in-depth preclinical and clinical testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Description of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network interactions and mathematical model assumptions</title><p>The interconnection between EGFR, PYK2 and c-Met signalling in TNBC cells and the involvement of STAT3 activation in a positive feedback loop [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] led us to examine the dynamic behaviours of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network in a quantitative and predictive manner. To this end, we constructed, calibrated and validated a computational model of this network. Reconstruction of the network structure revealed a multitude of interconnected positive and negative feedback loops, suggesting the network is likely to display highly non-linear and emergent dynamical properties. This model is based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which incorporates these key feedback interactions as well as other established regulatory mechanisms. A detailed reaction scheme of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, while a simplified schematic diagram depicting the core signal flow and salient feedback loops is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>.

On the other hand, PYK2 depletion substantially reduced EGFR level shortly (30&#x02013;120 mins) after EGF stimulation. These observations suggest that PYK2 either attenuates receptor ubiquitination and consequently its lysosomal degradation (reaction 3) or facilitates receptor deubiquitination (reaction 4). Although we assumed the former to be the case, the model&#x02019;s dynamic features are not significantly affected even if we assumed the later instead. The reciprocal interactions between PYK2 and EGFR form a positive feedback between these proteins, denoted as F1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Negative feedback loops involving EGFR</title><p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, EGFR is assumed to exist in three inter-convertible molecular states: unmodified, phosphorylated (activated) and ubiquitinated (EGFR<sub>ub</sub>); transition between these states are regulated by the relevant enzyme regulators. Upon EGF binding, EGFR undergoes rapid phosphorylation, internalization and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which targets it for lysosomal degradation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As activated EGFR induces phosphorylation (on tyrosine 371) and activation of Cbl (reaction 19) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which eventually leads to EGFR degradation, EGFR and Cbl are connected via a negative feedback. For simplicity, we avoid modelling of EGFR synthesis and degradation processes, and instead assume that EGFR molecules targeted for degradation are locked in a dynamic pool of ubiquitinated EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Similar to EGFR ubiquitination, EGFR phosphorylation is also regulated by a negative feedback loop between EGFR and tyrosine phosphatases, such as SHP-1 (denoted generically as PTP), which are activated by EGFR and induce receptor dephosphorylation and consequently its inactivation (reactions 21 and 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Transcriptional positive feedback between PYK2 and STAT3</title><p>By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase-reporter assay we previously showed that STAT3 directly binds to PYK2 promoter and enhances its transcription in response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells. We further showed that STAT3 inhibition by Stattic or AG490 (JAK/STAT3 inhibitor) significantly reduced PYK2 expression [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and that PYK2 enhances STAT3 phosphorylation on its primary activating tyrosine site (Y705) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Together, these data established a transcriptional positive feedback loop between PYK2 and STAT3, which is described by reactions 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 in the model&#x02019;s reaction scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and by F2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. Further, we showed that EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-468 cells, as opposed of PYK2-depleted cells induced co-localization of EGFR with phospho-STAT3 (pY705) at endosomal-like structures [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], implying that PYK2 is essential for EGFR-STAT3 interaction. The association between PYK2, EGFR and STAT3 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, the EGFR-PYK2-STAT3 interactions are modelled as a sequential cascade of signalling activation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Positive feedback between PYK2 and c-Met via STAT3</title><p>We previously showed that PYK2 positively regulates the steady-state level of c-Met protein as well as its transcription in response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We also showed that inhibition of c-Met using a specific inhibitor (PHA-665752) reduced the phosphorylation of both PYK2 and STAT3 in response to EGFR stimulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while STAT3 inhibition decreased c-Met transcription, suggesting that STAT3 enhances the transcription of c-Met (reaction 13).

As our calibrated EGFR-cMET-PYK2 model recapitulated the experimental data, we asked whether it can identify and prioritize synergistic drug combinations.</p><p>To this end, we considered EGFR, PYK2, c-Met and STAT3 as four potential targets with associated small-molecule inhibitors: Gefitinib, PF396, EMD and Stattic, respectively, and six different pair-wise combinations between them: Gefitinib+PF396, Gefitinib+Stattic, Gefitinib+EMD, PF396+EMD, PF396+Stattic and Stattic+EMD. To analyse the effects of these drug combinations on cell signalling, we simulated the steady-state levels of pERK and pSTAT3 in response to the individual drugs alone or in combinations, at their corresponding IC<sub>25</sub> levels.

Model simulations showed that while single-drug treatments only modestly suppressed pERK/pSTAT3, the combined treatments produced greater-than-additive effects for co-inhibition of EGFR-PYK2 or EGFR-c-Met, while this is much less pronounced for co-inhibition of c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).

Thus, to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the level of synergism of the considered drug pairs, we employed different methods to calculate the levels of drug synergy (Chou-Talalay&#x02019;s Combination Index, (CI score) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Bliss Independence (BI score) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Coefficient of Drug Interaction (CDI score) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s002">S2 Text</xref> for details). Synergy scores &#x0003c;1, = 1 or &#x0003e;1 indicate synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects, respectively; with the magnitude of synergism/antagonism signified by how much smaller/larger they are compared to 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, our model predicted a strong synergy between Gefitinib and PF396 or EMD, indicated by the CI scores much less than 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3 as outputs. In contrast, the CI scores for the combinations EMD-Stattic and PF396-Stattic are marginally different to 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3, indicating these drug pairs are unlikely to yield synergistic effects. In addition, co-targeting EGFR-STAT3 (by Gefitinib+Stattic) was predicted to be mostly additive, while co-targeting c-Met-PYK2 (by EMD+PF396) was slightly synergistic, which is more pronounced for pERK than pSTAT3. Importantly, these simulations were consistent between different synergy computational methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s009">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s010">S7</xref> Figs for BI and CDI scores). As pERK and pSTAT3 are major regulators of cell growth and survival, our simulations collectively led us to hypothesize that drug combinations that co-target EGFR-PYK2, EGFR-c-Met or PYK2-c-Met may yield synergistic effects in inhibiting TNBC growth, while those co-targeting STAT3 with either c-Met or PYK2 are unlikely to induce synergy.</p><p>To experimentally validate model predictions, we exposed TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells to increasing levels of Gefitinib, PF396, EMD, and Stattic in six combinations, and measured the effects on cell viability using the MTT assay and colony formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). To mitigate possible off-target effects (e.g. PF396 is known to also inhibit FAK), we aimed to use minimal drug concentrations sufficient to suppress downstream signalling. The combination index values (CI) were then calculated (CompuSyn software, CompuSyn. Inc) and synergistic (CI &#x0003c; 1), additive (CI = 1), and antagonistic (CI &#x0003e; 1) effects were defined.</p><p>As shown, the experimental data supported our predictions, and indicate that Gefitinib+PF396 was the most synergistic combination, followed by Gefitinib+EMD and Gefitinib+Stattic, whereas combined treatments of EMD+Stattic and PF396+Stattic did not show synergistic effects but mildly antagonistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Consistent with these results, we have recently showed that co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 substantially reduced the growth of basal-like TNBC cells both in vitro and in animal models, and further showed that this drug combination is more potent than dual inhibition of EGFR and c-Met [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

To investigate this we focused on EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting, and utilized the model to simulate the time-dependent signalling responses to EGF stimuli in the absence or presence of Gefitinib, PF396 or both. Interestingly, model simulations showed that although ERK activity was rapidly inhibited by Gefitinib as a single-drug treatment, the inhibition was transient and pERK bounced back at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The combined Gefitinib + PF396 treatment, however, abolished this late pERK recovery.

Active EGFR and PYK2 phosphorylations were strongly inhibited under Gefitinib (1&#x003bc;M) and PF396 (4&#x003bc;M) treatment, respectively, indicating these drugs acted on the desired targets (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s014">S11 Fig</xref>). Consistent with model simulations, the experimental data indeed reproduced the predicted late bounce back of both pERK and pSTAT3 in response to Gefitinib treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column), but not to the combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right column).

Moreover, PF396 treatment alone did not significantly affect ERK activity, and induced a transient response of pSTAT3 which is in accordance with previous simulations.

This suggests F4 strongly promotes the switch-like response of STAT3 to both Gefitinib and PF396. Conversely, F1 was found to have little impact on all dose-response curves, indicating this feedback plays a minor role in shaping these switches.

Using the Vanderbilt-based subtyping system [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the patients were classified into different subgroups: Basal-Like (BL1/2), Mesenchymal (M), Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR), and unclassified (UNC). Examining the mutation profiles of these patients showed that the patient heterogeneity primarily comes from variation in expression levels of the network nodes rather than point mutation events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s029">S6 Table</xref>). As our model was constructed based on the MDA-MB-468 cell line previously aligned to the Basal-Like (BL1) TNBC subtype (18), expression data from each patient was normalised by the median values of the BL1 patient subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g006">Fig 6</xref>, left). This normalisation step allowed us to tailor the cell-based model for each patient by adjusting the expression levels of the model species according to the normalised fold change. For instance, if a patient displays a two-fold increase in EGFR expression, then the EGFR abundance is doubled in the model describing that patient. This procedure was followed for all the model components resulting in 108 personalized kinetic models of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Materials &#x00026; Methods</xref> for more details). Note that an alternative normalisation strategy where we normalised all the patients against a patient whose expression profile most closely resembles that of the MDA-MB-468 cell line did not change the results&#x02019; main conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s021">S18</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s022">S19</xref> Figs). Using these patient-specific models, we next computed the predicted synergy levels of the Gefitinib+PF396 combination using the BI scores for each patient, which were then used to rank the patients, allowing identification of patient subgroups with different susceptibility to the co-treatment. To enhance the prediction accuracy of drug synergy, we excluded patients who did not respond at all to either drug when treated alone as informed by simulations.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the network nodes exhibit highly heterogeneous expression patterns across different TNBC subtypes within the discovery cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006192.s021">S18 Fig</xref>).

Next, we sorted the patients by the synergy index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7B</xref> for pERK as output and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006192.g007">Fig 7D</xref> for pSTAT3) and identified a highly &#x02018;synergistic subgroup&#x02019; (termed Q1) and a &#x02018;non-synergistic subgroup&#x02019; (Q3), containing patients having the synergy index values &#x0003c; the lower quartile and &#x0003e; the upper quartile, respectively.

Although combination therapies targeting multiple kinases have become necessary to effectively combat cancer, it remains a major challenge to identify the best combinations and most susceptible patients for clinical testing. However, drug combination identification based on experimental screening techniques remains costly and often identify only small numbers of synergistic combinations, which motivates development of alternative computational approaches for the task. Notably, an open challenge was recently launched by the DREAM consortium to computationally predict pair-wise drug synergy in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], resulting in over 30 community-generated algorithms, several of which performed significantly better than random guessing. Most were statistical methods but an ODE-based kinetic modeling approach was also proposed [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While the accuracy of the predictions were suboptimal, these efforts strongly demonstrate that computational prediction of drug synergy is feasible and can be useful in advancing the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we address the same challenge by employing a systems approach that integrates mechanistic kinetic modelling with experimental validation in an iterative manner. Focusing on the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC as a model system, we demonstrated the significant potential of this integrative approach in the rational identification and prioritization of synergistic drug combinations, as well as predictive stratification of patients for optimal benefit from these combinations. The strength of this approach further lies in its flexibility and scalability where the presented principles and computational frameworks could be reused and adapted to investigate similar questions in other systems and/or other tumour types beyond TNBC.</p><p>Model predictions validated by in vitro experimental data showed that EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting yields most synergistic effect in basal-like TNBC cell lines among other possible combinations, followed by EGFR-c-Met co-targeting. Indeed, previous studies suggest that combined targeting of both EGFR and c-Met receptors could be an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and have reported in vivo data supporting synergy in co-inhibition of EGFR-c-Met [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, our recent results further demonstrated the potent synergistic effect of EGFR and PYK2/FAK co-targeting on basal-like TNBC [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While these experimental data were obtained both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using TNBC cell lines and xenograft mouse models, respectively, the systems approach described here, using a quantitative modelling of EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC, precisely predicted the outcome results and the obtained synergistic effects of the combined treatments. Not only our model-based analysis could identify highly synergistic target combinations, we also uncovered non-synergistic (antagonistic) combinations for TNBC, such as c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 co-targeting, that is also valuable in informing subsequent studies. While EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting was identified to be synergistic in TNBC, PYK2 may have a larger role in coordinating EGFR and c-MET signalling depending on the cancer types, evident by data showing PYK2 activation was not affected by Gefitinib in lung cancer cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, the presence of drug synergy may be context specific and therefore should be treated accordingly.</p><p>Although effective drug combinations are being identified in many cancers, most resulted from empirical observations and/or expensive experimental screens [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that frequently lack mechanistic anchoring, making it difficult to predict if the identified combinations may work in different biological contexts (and so patients). This issue is similarly faced by machine-learning or statistical based computational approaches aimed to predict effective drug combinations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast, our modelling captures the mechanistic details contained within the interaction network under study. Thus, it allowed us to link the molecular and dynamic network features with observed drug synergy. Indeed, time-dependent simulations backed up by experiments helped reveal that while inhibition of EGFR or PYK2 alone (by Gefitinib or PF396, respectively) only temporarily suppressed the activities of ERK/STAT3 which were subsequently restored to basal levels; this activity recovery was abolished by the combined treatment. This finding suggests that knowledge of drug synergy could be gained by understanding and exploiting the dynamic behaviour of signalling networks. We further found that the signalling and phenotypic switches mediated primarily by the positive feedbacks within the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network contributed to the synergistic effects between Gefitinib and PF396. Importantly, feedback perturbation analysis unveiled that the PYK2-controlled feedback loops play crucial roles in mediating the signal restoration of ERK and STAT3. This analysis also helped pinpoint the PYK2-c-Met positive feedback loops as a critical regulator of the switches as well as drug synergy. These findings highlight the utilities of our mechanistic model in elucidating a systems-level understanding of drug-induced network dynamics and mechanisms that underlie monotherapy resistance as well as synergistic effects by drug combination.</p><p>The heterogeneous nature of TNBC is thought to underlie the sporadic and low response rates to targeted agents [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, effective strategy in order to improve patient stratification is strongly lacking. While the expression or mutation status of the drug targets can inform drug response, these are not always sufficient [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] particularly in the context of multi-target inhibition, possibly because these biomarkers do not capture the mechanistic connection between the targets. We provided a proof-of-concept demonstration of the prognostic significance of our modelling by showing its ability in stratifying patients into subgroups exhibiting different susceptibility for a certain combination treatment through generation of patient-specific models utilizing patient-specific data. As an example, this enabled prediction of two patient subgroups, one highly susceptible to EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting and one least likely to benefit from the same combination. Importantly, differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of PYK2 was particularly enriched in the highly responsive subgroup, consistent between two independent patient cohorts analysed. Interestingly, upregulation of EGFR was not predicted to be significantly enriched in this group, however this finding was not surprising given that high EGFR expression is not always predictive of sensitivity to EGFR-directed inhibition [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These results support the notion that network-based biomarkers, rather than expression of the drug target, could offer better sensitivity indicator for drugs co-targeting. While the patient stratification analyses here were mainly focused on the EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition, the patient-specific models could be utilised to discover new drug combinations in each patient for personalized therapies. Moreover, as our models were primarily kinases based, future availability of high-resolution proteomic data from patients instead of transcriptomic data would potentially further enhance model predictability.</p><p>In summary, our systems modelling presents a powerful and highly adaptable approach for the rational design and predictive prioritization of combinatorial therapies in an individualized manner, providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other cancers. Given the space of possible drug combinations is vast while clinical trials are slow and costly, this predictive approach opens exciting avenues for drug repurposing and quick translation of combination therapies into the clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec017"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Antibodies, reagents and chemicals</title><p>The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA): rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pPYK2 (Y402, sc-101790, 1:1,000 WB), STAT3 (C-20, 1:1,000 WB), ERK1/2 (sc-93, 1:1,000 WB), pERK1/2 (pT202/ pY204.22A, sc-136521, 1:500 WB), cMet (sc-10, 1:1000 WB) and mouse monoclonal antibody against pSTAT3 (Y705, sc-8059, 1:500 WB).

Specifically, four patients contain EGFR mutations, two contain PYK2 mutations, another two contain STAT3 mutations, and Met and Cbl mutation were found in one single patient. The most common mutation types are SNP. However, searching for these mutations in the COSMIC mutation catalogue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>), the most comprehensive mutation database currently available, we found mostly no functional effects (i.e. GOF or LOF) reported for these genetic changes, except that STAT3 H410R (indicated by an asterisk) is associated with induction of STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3, CCL2, JUNB and BCL3 upregulation in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia [<xref rid="pcbi.1006192.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
