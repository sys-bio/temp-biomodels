<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> colonizes half of the world&#x02019;s population as the dominant member of the gastric microbiota resulting in a lifelong chronic infection. Host responses toward the bacterium can result in asymptomatic, pathogenic or even favorable health outcomes; however, mechanisms underlying the dual role of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> as a commensal versus pathogenic organism are not well characterized. Recent evidence suggests mononuclear phagocytes are largely involved in shaping dominant immunity during infection mediating the balance between host tolerance and succumbing to overt disease. We combined computational modeling, bioinformatics and experimental validation in order to investigate interactions between macrophages and intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Global transcriptomic analysis on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in a gentamycin protection assay at six time points unveiled the presence of three sequential host response waves: an early transient regulatory gene module followed by sustained and late effector responses. Kinetic behaviors of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are linked to differential expression of spatiotemporal response waves and function to induce effector immunity through extracellular and intracellular detection of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. We report that bacterial interaction with the host intracellular environment caused significant suppression of regulatory NLRC3 and NLRX1 in a pattern inverse to early regulatory responses. To further delineate complex immune responses and pathway crosstalk between effector and regulatory PRRs, we built a computational model calibrated using time-series RNAseq data. Our validated computational hypotheses are that: 1) NLRX1 expression regulates bacterial burden in macrophages; and 2) early host response cytokines down-regulate NLRX1 expression through a negative feedback circuit. This paper applies modeling approaches to characterize the regulatory role of NLRX1 in mechanisms of host tolerance employed by macrophages to respond to and/or to co-exist with intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov">www.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>) No. HHSN272201000056C to JB-R and funds from the Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimml.org">www.nimml.org</ext-link>).

<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a microaerophilic Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium that colonizes 50% of the world&#x02019;s population establishing a decades-long infection as the dominant member of the human gastric microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> colonization results in health outcomes ranging from protection against allergies, diabetes, asthma and chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases to favoring peptic ulcers and cancer. A small proportion (10&#x02013;15%) of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>-infected individuals experience serious pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore investigating the complex tolerance mechanisms that facilitate the co-existence between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and its human host may yield a deeper understanding of mechanisms of immunoregulation at mucosal sites. Furthermore, characterizing innate immune mechanisms that reduce the negative impact of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection on host fitness without directly affecting microbial burden may result in host-based precision medicine strategies that do not rely on anti-microbial treatment.</p><p>Mucosal pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNP; macrophages and dendritic cells) are essential for detection of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and required for initiation of both effector and regulatory immune responses following infection [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The loss of a single PRR can cause dramatic changes in immunological parameters and disease outcomes. For example, loss of TLR2 signaling during <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection results in dysregulated host responses and severe immunopathology [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Conversely, NOD1-deficieny is associated with significantly reduced interferon production at the expense of higher <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> burden in the gastric mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, characterizing the mechanisms underlying the modulation of PRR expression and signaling by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection at the systems level may lend valuable new insights into the regulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory host responses, bacterial burden and tissue damage at the gut mucosa. Additionally, modulating host immunity through genetic manipulation of PRRs represents an effective means to better understand the mechanisms by which <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> endures as a commensal or pathogenic organism.</p><p>Although traditionally recognized mainly as an extracellular microbe, more recent evidence suggests that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> can thrive as a facultative intracellular bacterium and replicate within gastric epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (reviewed [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). In our novel pig model of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection we demonstrated presence of the bacterium inside myeloid rich lymphoid aggregates as well as the induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, we recently published a tissue-level computational and mathematical model that explores the role of macrophage phenotypes on disease pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a follow up study, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture system to study intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and validated the importance of myeloid cells in maintaining bacterial loads by demonstrating reduced colonization following macrophage depletion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although acknowledged, mechanisms underlying host responses to intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> are widely unresolved.</p><p>This study was designed to investigate immunomodulatory mechanisms of macrophages infected with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Using global transcriptome sequencing we identify three temporal molecular modules (early, sustained and late) significantly altered in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from mice. In addition, we characterize a cohort of genes significantly down-regulated during co-culture. Analysis of PRR expression in co-culture studies confirms that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection suppresses regulatory nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein X1 (NLRX1). Many canonical PRR and cytokine signaling pathways modulated by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> converge at NLRX1. Limited mechanistic insight exists for cell-specific immunomodulatory roles of NLRX1 as well as host-mediated or pathogen-driven suppression of this regulatory NLR. We present a validated computational model for characterizing novel feedback loop tolerance mechanisms implicated in the regulation of microbial burden and innate immune responses in macrophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>
<italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> induces distinct temporal waves in innate immunity in macrophages</title><p>To study macrophage-specific responses to intracellular replication we co-cultured primary wild type (WT) bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> using a gentamycin protection assay and examined global gene expression at six discrete time points (0, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 720 minutes post-co-culture). Our analysis identified 1,077 differentially expressed genes due to infection in a time-dependent manner (FDR p-value &#x0003c; 0.05). Clustering was used to categorize significantly altered transcripts into 12 gene modules (Clusters 1&#x02013;12). Within each cluster, genes have similar temporal magnitudes, synchronized expression patterns and common biological roles when analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chronologically, the profiles of the clusters broadly capture early transient (C4), sustained (C3, C9, C12), late (C6, C7, C10 C11) and suppressed (C8) patterns (<bold><xref rid="pone.0137839.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="pone.0137839.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137839.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Intracellular <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> induces temporal waves in macrophage immunity.</title><p>Clustering analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes (FDR p-value &#x0003c;0.05) obtained from RNAseq performed on macrophages co-cultured with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>.

This dataset provides evidence that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infected macrophages up-regulate <italic>Il10</italic> mRNA through similar means early during infection (C4). We have further characterized this regulatory signature by identifying increased <italic>E2f5</italic>, <italic>Erg1</italic> and <italic>Csrnp1</italic>, molecules with anti-tumor properties, and <italic>Prdm1</italic>, whose gene product BLIMP-1 is a negative regulator of interferon (IFN) beta signaling. <italic>Ddit4</italic> (also referred to as <italic>Redd1</italic>), a glucose-regulated repressor of Akt/mTORC1 signaling and promoter of autophagy, was also among the rapidly induced transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although dominated by immune suppressors, the early peak also contained pro-inflammatory mediators <italic>Csf2</italic> and <italic>IL23a</italic>.</p><p>The sustained innate response wave includes genes whose transcriptional profile is induced around 60 minutes and remains expressed throughout the duration of the experiment. Functionally, this phase corresponds to effector immunity elicited by recognition of extracellular bacteria and inflammatory cytokines. TLR2-dependent signaling is significantly enriched (C9) and likely governs the sustained response in a manner similarly described for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infected DCs [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Proinflammatory TLR2-mediated cytokines <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>IL1a</italic>, <italic>Saa3</italic> (C12) as well as <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Nos2</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic> and <italic>Ccl7</italic> (C3) were all induced early and remained at high levels throughout the duration of the co-culture. The transcript for IL-12, an immunomodulatory cytokine involved in orchestrating T cell responses, clustered in C3. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are an important innate defense mechanism for epithelial cells to kill <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and are generally enhanced with pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly we found that AMP were largely unchanged in our macrophage dataset; <italic>Ltf</italic> and <italic>Lyz</italic> cluster in C2 and were slightly down-regulated and neither &#x003b2;-defensins nor S100 genes were significantly altered. This suggests some degree of cell-specificity in response to intracellular versus extracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> stimulation as well as differences in induction of host response between macrophages and epithelial cells.</p><p>The late wave contains genes with simultaneous onset of expression beginning at 240 minutes that continues to rise through the last collection. Late clusters are representative of host response to intracellular bacterial stimuli resulting in type I interferon signaling (C6-7, C10-11). <italic>Nod1</italic> (C10) and its responsive genes <italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic> (C11) were elevated late during infection as well as interferon-induced genes <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Ifit1-3</italic>, <italic>Iigp1</italic> and <italic>Rsad2</italic> (C7). Similar to sustained genes, the later transcriptional pattern is not unique to macrophages and is observed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> treated DCs [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Down-regulated transcripts also coherently group together (C8) and signify genes that may be modulated by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> to thrive in the host environment. Most C8 transcripts are intrinsic membrane associated molecules involved in signal transduction. Clusters 1,2 and 5 included genes associated, enzyme and protein binging, cell adhesion, and cell division respectively but were relatively unaltered. Moreover, these clusters contain transcripts with the highest p-values indicating that these three clusters may not be significant in this study.</p><p>Together these data suggest that mechanisms of mononuclear phagocyte immunity to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> occur sequentially and may depend on the location of the bacterium with respect to the host cell. Additionally, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> induces a unique regulatory gene module with an early transient peak during infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Time-sensitive innate immune responses to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> are induced by intracellular and extracellular PRRs in macrophages</title><p>Innate PRR families facilitate the recognition of unique components from microbes, host response and/or the environment to subsequently induce classic molecular cascades that efficiently modulate immunity. TLRs 2 and 9, RIG-I, NOD1, NOD2, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRC5, NLRP9, NLRP12 and NLRX1 have all been reported in the context of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection with roles ranging from detection of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> to initiation of inflammation or regulatory responses at the gastrointestinal mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Statistical comparison between uninfected and infected samples at every time point highlighted significant temporal behavior for each PRR (FDR p-value &#x0003c; 0.05).

TLR2 is essential for recognizing <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> by dendritic cells and therefore it is not unexpected to find its transcript at significantly high levels during our co-culture. Moreover, TLR2 represents the only known mechanism whereby <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> induces a significant regulatory signature, which is in line with our clustering results above (<xref rid="pone.0137839.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, C4) [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Lipoproteins from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and other microbes can signal through either a TLR1/2 or TLR2/6 heterodimer however this has not been extensively investigated [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

NOD1 is recognized as a primary contributor of host response to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> through the detection of intracellular peptidoglycan, a component of the bacterium&#x02019;s cell wall, and is likely a key detection method used by macrophages to identify infiltrated bacteria in our project [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

We expanded our analysis to encompass inflammasome components and found that indeed <italic>Casp-1</italic> and <italic>Casp-11</italic> were both significantly induced at late time points. Notably, Caspase-11 was recently identified as an innate receptor for intracellular LPS and although <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori-</italic>derived components do not directly induce Caspase-11 it has not been confirmed whether the live bacterium can be recognized through this novel mode of detection [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

For instance, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> detection through TLR2 and NOD1 can both result in ample NF-&#x003ba;B activation and inflammatory cytokine production. However, detection by PRRs is dependent upon bacterial location (e.g. TLR2 is extracellular whereas NOD1 is intracellular) resulting in pathway activation at different spatiotemporal scales. Cytokine signaling triggers positive feed-forward loops that further activate the same molecular profile (i.e. TRAF6 phosphorylation occurs due to detection of bacteria (e.g. TLRs) and cytokines (e.g. TNFR)). Additionally, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is tightly controlled through numerous self-regulated negative feedback mechanisms, including PPAR&#x003b3; and NLRX1 [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Thus we added hypothetical negative and positive feedback loops from undefined transcription factors induced by early and sustained responses, respectively, to NLRX1.

In this study we took a host-centric view and investigated dynamic macrophage-dependent mechanisms involved in detecting and regulating intracellular survival of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. We analyzed the activity of PRRs and found that all measured PRR transcripts were significantly altered at one or more time points with the exception of <italic>Tlr12</italic>. Presently, NOD1 and TLR2 are the main receptors associated with detection of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, and indeed we observed upregulation of these molecules in our dataset. Importantly, we report for the first time that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> stimulation of macrophages significantly enhances mRNA levels of <italic>Caspase11</italic>, a non-canonical caspase protein recognized as a receptor for cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> has low efficacy for many PRRs partially as a result of the molecular evolution of its surface molecules [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> LPS has achieved structural mimicry akin to human blood antigens by resembling polysaccharides found in mammalian hosts and thus is nearly undetectable by the LPS-receptor TLR4 [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

To note, TLR5 mRNA and protein levels are shown to increase when measured in other <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> co-cultures whereas our data demonstrates significant down-regulation of the molecule. Since we are utilizing an intracellular infection method, it is possible that this co-culture system does not yield adequate extracellular bacteria levels for proper TLR5 activation.

Modulating expression and cellular distribution of PRRs following host-microbe interaction is a fundamental tactic used by immune cells to alter sensitivity to bacteria and reduce the inflammatory impact of stimulation. Classically this property is affiliated with the intestinal environment where adjusting expression and bio-geographical distribution of PRRs by epithelial cells and MNP is directly involved in the balance between homeostasis and development of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].

Analytical results on our computational model propose a novel scenario for immunomodulation in which host responses rapidly induced following <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> colonization of macrophages regulate NLRX1 suppression; a prediction is being investigated intensively in ongoing validation studies.</p><p>Another key validation experiment confirmed model predictions that sustained (i.e. <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>) and late (i.e. <italic>Iigp1</italic>) effector molecules were largely unchanged in NLRX1-deficient BMDM compared to wild type during the gentamycin protection assay. Our studies do show significant differences in the induction of <italic>Ifng</italic> and ROS in NLRX1-null macrophages occurring through an undefined mechanism. Importantly, one model-driven hypothesis is that loss of NLRX1 would result in higher levels of early cytokines. We indeed observed higher levels of the cytokine transcript for <italic>Il23</italic> in <italic>Nlrx1-/-</italic> BMDM. Il-23 has been studied with several infectious disease models and is largely involved in regulating robust innate immunity required for containing bacterial burden [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. On the other hand, early <italic>Il10</italic> response measurements were very similar between genotypes. IL-23 and IL-10 signal through different mechanisms and are differentially regulated in mononuclear phagocytes infected with various pathogens, thus these pathways may be working independently [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and future studies could investigate the contrast in signaling with respect to NLRX1. It remains unclear whether lower bacterial loads represent more efficient killing of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> by macrophages, reduced replication rates due to altered intracellular singling (i.e. autophagy), or both. NLRX1 is believed to antagonize NF-&#x003ba;B activity, modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), promote autophagy and interrupt interferon signaling [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] via direct interaction with intermediate transduction proteins, TRAF6 and MAVS. These findings, however, remain controversial and vary among murine models of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. For example, NLRX1 has been identified as a regulator of mitochondrial antiviral immunity through interference with RIG-I-MAVS and TRAF6-NF-kB signaling to attenuate inflammation during Sendai virus and influenza infections and LPS induced shock [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Nlrx1-/-</italic> mice have reduced interferon responses during influenza independent of MAVS interactions [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similarly, the debate that NLRX1 potentiates ROS production [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137839.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] or not [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] is ongoing. Since NLRX1 serves as a cytosolic receptor for host and microbe components, it is likely that NLRX1 acts in a pathogen-specific manner, potentially contributing to conflicting results. Our results support the notion that NLRX1 negatively influences ROS production. Additionally we present IFN-&#x003b3; as a unique identifier for altered immunity resulting from loss of NLRX1.</p><p>A potential limitation of our findings could result from the slight misfit of early cytokines in our model. Experimental data suggests that the early response wave reaches values closer to baseline and more rapidly than our model. One possible explanation to rationalize this result is the lack of an unforeseen feedback loop that negatively regulates early responses independent of NF-&#x003ba;B. Some early genes, such as <italic>Ddit4</italic>, are involved in autophagy and regulated by lipid and glucose metabolism suggesting roles for both classical NF-&#x003ba;B and alternative enzymatic signaling [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Future model extensions could incorporate metabolic and autophagy modules to enhance fitting of initial transient signaling components and provide clarity for induction of this novel regulatory element. Likewise, we did not predict the result of IFN-&#x003b3; since type III interferon signaling was not included in our present model; this branch of immunity could be added in future renditions. Additionally, it is possible that the inverse behavior observed between early response elements and NLRX1 is coincidental rather than causal. Given over 100 genes in the early response element, it is not feasible to experimentally test each molecule&#x02019;s ability to control transcriptional activity of NLRX1. Future model versions with factorial simulations or sparse sensitivity analyses designs will help narrow more likely candidates for validation. Lastly, the use of only one <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strain (SS1) in our experimental validation is a limitation in characterizing role of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> virulence factors on the expression of host PRR signaling. Strain SS1 is positive for cagA and cagE virulence factors but vacA inactive [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Interestingly, the only other study on NLRX1 behavior during <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> co-culture shows comparable results using an <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> strain negative for cagA and cagE yet positive for vacA [<xref rid="pone.0137839.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This suggests that NLRX1 regulation may be more dependent on host response elements rather than bacterial influence however this speculation will need to be confirmed in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we combined transcriptomic analyses, mathematical modeling and experimental validation of key computational predictions to characterize novel macrophage-dependent mechanisms involved in detection and response to intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. The regulatory response element that we describe involves genes that have not yet been connected with disease outcomes during <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection thus presenting an exciting new avenue for potential investigation. Through analytical studies of a calibrated mathematical model, we determine that the dynamic behavior of one molecule, NLRX1, is tightly regulated and essential for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> colonization. Concisely, persistently high levels of microbial colonies can only occur when NLRX1 is involved in a feedback loop that suppresses sustained and late immune waves. Finally, our integrated computational and experimental validation studies also shed light on an undescribed role for IFN-&#x003b3; in NLRX1 immunity as well as a unique scenario for host-mediated suppression of NLRX1. Broadly, our model of host response to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection represents an invaluable tool to study the mucosal immune system as a massively interacting information processing system. Moreover, our findings present new data that could assist in the development of host tolerance-based precision medicine strategies that do not rely on anti-microbial treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Tech and met or exceeded the requirements of the Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health and the Animal Welfare Act.
