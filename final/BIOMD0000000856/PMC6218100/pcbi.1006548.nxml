Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the <sc>Start</sc> transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cell&#x02019;s overall ploidy and <italic>WHI5</italic> gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect &#x02018;sizer&#x02019; behaviour in G1 and a &#x02018;timer&#x02019; in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an &#x02018;adder&#x02019; over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Proliferating cells need to coordinate the initiation of genome replication and cell division with cell growth. In particular, the average time between two division events must precisely allow for a doubling in cell volume. Any systematic deviation from this balance would lead to progressive changes in cell size over consecutive generations and to a breakdown of biochemical processes. Here, we study two molecular mechanisms by which budding yeast cells might achieve this coordination. Through mathematical modelling, we show that the dilution of an inhibitor of cell cycle progression by cell growth can facilitate size homeostasis. But this mechanism fails to reproduce the size of mutant cells in which parts of the control machinery have been altered. By contrast, the titration of an activator against a constant number of genomic sites recapitulates these data and achieves size homeostasis. Since the control network of cell cycle progression in budding yeast is structurally similar to mammalian cells, our model could indicate a common mechanism for size control.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M00354X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nov&#x000e1;k</surname><given-names>B&#x000e9;la</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01-GM078989-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7560-6013</contrib-id><name><surname>Tyson</surname><given-names>John J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>FSH and BN are funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Strategic LoLa grant BB/M00354X/1.

In particular, the average time between two successive cell divisions must allow for a doubling in cell mass (or volume, which we will use interchangeably in the following). Any systematic deviation from this balance would lead to progressive changes in size over consecutive generations, eventually leading to the breakdown of biochemical processes. However, despite mounting evidence for active size control in various cell types and across different organisms [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], if and how cells measure their size and relay this information to the cell cycle remains controversial [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>An elegant way to coordinate cell division and growth is to restrict passage through a certain cell cycle stage to cells that are larger than a particular target size [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such &#x02018;size checkpoints&#x02019; have been proposed to underlie size control at the <sc>Start</sc> transition in budding yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and at the G2/M transition in fission yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and slime mould plasmodia [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The critical size required to pass these transitions depends, among other things, on the ploidy of the cell and its nutritional status [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To establish a size checkpoint, cells need to generate a size-dependent biochemical signal. Yet, most cellular macromolecules increase in abundance proportionally to cell volume, so that their concentration remains constant and the reactions they are involved in are independent of size [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several proteins that defy this general rule have been indicated in size control. The mitotic activator Cdc25, for instance, increases in concentration with size in fission yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while Whi5, an inhibitor of <sc>Start</sc> in budding yeast, is diluted by cell growth [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This suggest a general mechanism, in which size control emerges from the interplay between size-dependent and size-independent cell cycle regulators. Here, we study this intriguing possibility, focusing on the budding yeast cell cycle.</p><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> divides asymmetrically, with size control mainly operating in the new-born daughter cell when it commits to enter the cell cycle anew at the <sc>Start</sc> transition [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Passage through <sc>Start</sc> is driven by activation of the transcription factor SBF [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In early G1-phase, before <sc>Start,</sc> SBF is kept inactive by its stoichiometric inhibitor Whi5 [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To enter the cell cycle, the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (encoded by the <italic>CDC28</italic> gene) in conjunction with its regulatory binding partner Cln3 phosphorylates Whi5, which partially liberates SBF from inhibition and induces the synthesis of other G1 cyclins (Cln1 and Cln2). Cln1/2:Cdk1 complexes then accelerate the phosphorylation of Whi5 and activation of SBF, thereby promoting the <sc>Start</sc> transition [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent experiments show that during G1 the concentration of Cln3, the activator of <sc>Start</sc>, is constant, while the concentration of Whi5 decreases, suggesting that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism facilitates size control [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, previous theoretical considerations and experimental data suggested a different mechanism based on the titration of an activator that increases in molecule number during growth&#x02013;as would be the case if its concentration is kept constant&#x02013;against a fixed number of nuclear sites [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of the budding yeast cell cycle. At its core, the model comprises a simple description of gene expression in which both size-dependent and size-independent synthesis of proteins emerge seamlessly from the assumption of differential affinity of genes for &#x02018;transcription machinery&#x02019;. This allows size-dependent proteins to maintain a fixed concentration during growth without the need for complex, gene-specific regulation and for size-independent proteins to maintain a fixed number of molecules per cell. Together, such size-dependent and -independent proteins can generate size-dependent biochemical signals for progression through the cell cycle. Using this model, we show that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism can facilitate size homeostasis and correctly account for changes in protein synthesis observed in experiments that perturb the number of gene copies of cell cycle regulators as well as the overall ploidy of the cell. However, the model fails to reproduce changes in cell size seen in some of these mutants. Intriguingly, a combination of inhibitor dilution and the titration of an activator against genomic sites correctly recapitulates these changes in cell size. Such a model also produces cell size patterns consistent with a &#x02018;sizer&#x02019; mechanism in G1 and a &#x02018;timer&#x02019; period comprising S, G2 and M-phase, which combine to yield an &#x02018;adder-type&#x02019; behaviour over the entire cell cycle; an observation recently made experimentally [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, our model unites various experimental findings that were previously thought incompatible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>A model for size-dependent and -independent protein expression</title><p>Experimental evidence suggests that size control emerges from the interplay of regulatory proteins whose synthesis rates depend on cell size and their size-independent counterparts [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To simulate the expression of such proteins we propose a simple mathematical model based on the differential binding of transcription machinery (TM) to genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We model cell growth by assuming that components of the TM are themselves synthesised from size-dependent genes, which makes the production of TM autocatalytic, and that products of size-dependent genes control the increase in cell volume. These simple assumptions result in an exponential rise in both the amount of TM and cell size over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), as is characteristic for budding yeast both in single cells and at the population level [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi.1006548.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006548.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>A model for size-dependent and -independent gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription machinery (TM) binds with high affinity to the genes of size-independent proteins (top), while binding to the genes of size-dependent proteins is weaker (bottom).

Moreover, cell growth in the model depends on proteins that are themselves made by TM, which naturally leads to a direct proportionality between cell volume and transcriptional capacity. More precisely, as cells produce more and more TM their volume growth rate increases by the same extent, such that the number of TM molecules per unit cell volume remains constant. The fact that larger cells contain more TM translates into an increased occupation of size-dependent genes by TM, while size-independent genes are already fully occupied in small cells due to their high affinity for TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Consequently, the transcriptional output from size-dependent genes increases with cell size, allowing their proteins to maintain a constant concentration during exponential cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). By contrast, expression from size-independent genes remains almost constant, such that their proteins are diluted by cell growth. Note that protein transcription is a highly complex, non-equilibrium process involving the binding of transcription factors, chromatin remodelling and multiple layers of regulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], e.g. cell cycle and nutrient-dependent control. We propose that the basic size-related regulation shown here operates alongside these other mechanisms to compensate for changes in cell size. Furthermore, the two protein classes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1A</xref> represent extremes on either end of the binding-affinity spectrum. Intermediate expression patterns, including proteins that switch from being size-dependent to size-independent during cell growth, can arise in between these extremes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s004">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Our gene expression model predicts that the two principal gene types react differently to a ploidy increase, i.e., a doubling of their copy number and of the rest of the genome. In particular, size-dependent genes compensate for ploidy by splitting TM between the two gene copies and the genome, whereas their size-independent counterparts compete efficiently for TM with other genes and increase in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). However, an additional gene copy in the absence of a ploidy increase leads to a higher expression of either gene type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Hence, protein synthesis depends on the copy-number-to-ploidy ratio for size-dependent genes and strictly on the gene copy number for size-independent genes. In summary, our model uses a simple mechanism to explain why size-independent proteins are diluted by cell growth, whereas size-dependent proteins keep a constant concentration, without the need for complex, gene-specific regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Dilution of Whi5 can establish size control</title><p>Next, we asked whether the differential expression of cell cycle regulators according to the above model would allow budding yeast cells to control their size.

Hence, we developed a cell cycle model centred on this transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In this model, passage through <sc>Start</sc> is facilitated by the activation of SBF, which is opposed by the stoichiometric inhibitor Whi5. Through the phosphorylation of Whi5, Cln3 liberates SBF from inhibition, thus driving cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s005">S2A Fig</xref>). Based on experimental observations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we assume that Whi5 is a size-independent gene, while all other proteins in our model are size-dependent. Consequently, cell growth in G1 dilutes the inhibitor of <sc>Start,</sc> Whi5, while the activator Cln3 is maintained at constant concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), as has been observed experimentally [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our model shows that this inhibitor-dilution mechanism can establish a size threshold for <sc>Start</sc>, where SBF is relieved from Whi5 inhibition only after sufficient growth has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This transition is rapid and switch-like because of positive feedback via Cln1 and Cln2, which are expressed in response to SBF activation and further phosphorylate Whi5 [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The positive feedback loop creates a bistable switch, which implements the threshold response to graded changes in Whi5 concentration caused by cell volume growth, providing a sensitive size-sensing mechanism. After <sc>Start</sc> has been passed, growth is restricted to the bud [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and it continues until the end of the cycle, when the degradation of Clb1 and Clb2 initiates the separation of mother and daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, our model readily shows size homeostasis over multiple generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, lower panel). In particular, daughter cells, which we follow in our simulations because they show strong size control, reach the same size as their mothers, suggesting that Whi5 dilution can indeed couple cell division to cell growth.</p><fig id="pcbi.1006548.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006548.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Inhibitor dilution allows for size homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Influence diagram of the cell cycle model.

It has been proposed that this negative correlation between cell size at birth and Whi5 concentration results from the synthesis of a fixed amount of Whi5 during a period of fixed duration, which encompasses S-, G2- and M-phases in budding yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By design our model accounts for this synthesis pattern, restricting Whi5 synthesis to the post-<sc>Start</sc> period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We find that new-born cells do indeed exhibit a size-dependent Whi5 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). This allows for the adjustment of G1 duration to a cell&#x02019;s birth size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). In summary, our model demonstrates that size-independent synthesis of Whi5 and its dilution during G1 can allow cells to maintain their size over multiple generations by creating a cell-size threshold for <sc>Start</sc>. Furthermore, the synthesis of a fixed amount of Whi5 per cell cycle can adjust for size differences by tuning G1 duration.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Inhibitor-dilution model fails to reproduce all ploidy effects</title><p>To further explore the model&#x02019;s ability to reproduce size control, we compared it to experiments that vary the copy number of <italic>CLN3</italic> and <italic>WHI5</italic>, as well as the cell&#x02019;s overall ploidy [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These data were originally used to prove that Whi5&#x02019;s synthesis rate is independent of cell size, while Cln3&#x02019;s synthesis rate increases in larger cells ([<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

The resulting simulations correctly predict the changes in protein synthesis rates for both Whi5 and Cln3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In particular, they recapitulate the copy-number dependence of Whi5 synthesis rate and the copy-number-to-ploidy dependence of Cln3 synthesis rate. The model also correctly predicts the two-fold size increase between haploid and diploid cells. However, our simulations fail to reproduce the size increase observed between haploid and diploid cells with the same number of <italic>WHI5</italic> copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). More precisely, since protein synthesis rates for both Whi5 and Cln3 are similar in haploid and diploid cells with one <italic>WHI5</italic> copy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s006">S3A Fig</xref>), the model predicts a similar size threshold for <sc>Start</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In fact, considering the slight decrease in Whi5 synthesis rate observed in experiments [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], diploid cells with one <italic>WHI5</italic> should show a slight decrease in size compared to haploid cells according to our model. Reference [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] attributes the observed increase in cell size between haploid and diploid cells (with one or two copies of <italic>WHI5</italic>) to a delay in S/G2/M progression for diploid cells. Testing this hypothesis, we find that it only partially accounts for the observed size changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s006">S3B Fig</xref>). In particular, diploid cells with one <italic>WHI5</italic> are predicted to be smaller than haploid cells with two <italic>WHI5</italic>, suggesting a larger influence of Whi5 synthesis rate than ploidy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s006">S3C Fig</xref>). However, in experiments the opposite is observed ([<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, a delay in S/G2/M progression together with the observed increase in Whi5 synthesis rate would lead to a more than two-fold difference between haploid and diploid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s006">S3C Fig</xref>), in contradiction to experimental data [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

In particular, it has been suggested that Cln3 is titrated against SBF bindings sites on the genome [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on these suggestions, we augmented the inhibitor-dilution model with a titration mechanism to test whether these two concepts can be brought into unison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In the pure inhibitor-dilution model, SBF, Whi5 and Cln3 interact in a strictly concentration-based manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s005">S2A Fig</xref>). By contrast, the titration model assumes that SBF occupies a fixed number of sites on the genome. In early G1 (i.e., in small daughter cells), these sites are filled with Whi5-inhibited SBF complexes to which Cln3 can bind tightly in a stoichiometric fashion. Once bound, Cln3 slowly hypo-phosphorylates Whi5 and dissociates in the process. However, it can rapidly rebind to unphosphorylated SBF:Whi5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s005">S2B Fig</xref>). As the cell grows larger, the number of Cln3 molecules per cell increases (Cln3 is a size-dependent protein, whose concentration is maintained constant in G1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This leads to a gradual accumulation of Cln3:Cdk1 heterodimers on Promoter:SBF:Whi5 complexes until all sites are filled, at which point free Cln3:Cdk1 kinase complexes emerge in the nucleus. Free Cln3:Cdk1 then promotes rapid hyper-phosphorylation of SBF-bound and free Whi5, facilitating the <sc>Start</sc> transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

An ideal sizer mechanism suggests that the final volume at the end of the sizer period is independent of the initial volume, such that the added volume shows a linear slope of minus one, i.e., small cells need to grow more to reach the critical size. By contrast, exponentially growing cells that employ a perfect timer show a slope of plus one in the added volume as small cells grow less during the same time increment. Note that a slope of exactly one is only observed if cells double their mass within the phase that uses a timer, e.g. if the timer is employed over the whole cell cycle of a symmetrically dividing cell.

However, the added volume is not directly sensed by the system in any way. Instead the negative slope of the sizer compensates for the positive slope of the timer.</p><p>The results above raise the question as to why cells employ two seemingly different strategies in G1 and S/G2/M-phases, a sizer and a timer, respectively. Presumably, S, G2 and M-phase are completed fast, with a size-independent timing, to allow the mother cell to start the next budding event, while size control is relegated to the daughter cell&#x02019;s G1 phase. In addition, a timer period of constant length in combination with a size-independent Whi5 synthesis allows the cell to produce a constant, size-independent amount of Whi5 per cell cycle (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g005">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">2E</xref>). This constant Whi5 amount is part of the mechanism that tunes G1 length with respect to birth size. Hence, the S/G2/M timer helps to set up the G1 sizer. We also note that our simulations show an imperfect sizer with a slight positive correlation between the cell volume at <sc>Start</sc> and the birth volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, left panel), as has been found experimentally [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whereas an ideal sizer requires the size threshold for <sc>Start</sc> to be independent of birth size, we find that cells which are larger at birth progress through <sc>Start</sc> at a slightly larger size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). According to our model, the main reason for this threshold change is the distribution of Whi5 molecules at cell division. In particular, larger cells are born with slightly higher amounts of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), since some of the Whi5-containing complexes are distributed according to the volume ratio of mother and daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).

This has also been observed for the majority of cellular mRNAs, suggesting that adaptation to volume growth occurs at the transcriptional level [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Based on these observations, we propose a general mathematical model for gene expression in growing cells which assumes that a limiting component of the transcription machinery, which we named TM and that may correspond to an RNA polymerase or factors influencing chromatin accessibility [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], is produced in an autocatalytic manner by transcribing its own mRNA. Under conditions where nutrients and precursors are not limiting, this leads to an exponential increase in TM. If we assume that the increase in cell volume depends on proteins that are themselves transcribed by TM, the exponential rise in TM directly translates into an exponential increase in cell volume and it naturally leads to a direct proportionality between both, i.e., protein synthesis rates per unit volume remains constant. This scaling is an emergent property of the system and does not require complex regulation or a dedicated mechanism that measures size and tunes transcriptional capacity accordingly. In very large cells, genes become saturated, at which point transcription rates remain constant and cell growth transitions into a phase of linear increase. These features of the model are consistent with a large body of experimental literature showing exponential growth of cell volume and transcription for small cells which plateaus when cells exceed a certain size [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Given this model of gene expression, two different types of genes emerge in our simulations based on their affinity to TM. Genes that bind TM with high affinity are saturated early, in small cells, and thus show size-independent protein synthesis. Consequently, they give rise to size-independent proteins, whose amount is constant, leading to a decreasing concentration in growing cells. Whi5 is an example of such a protein [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to their high affinity, size-independent genes compete efficiently for TM and an increase in their copy number, due to gene or genome duplication, directly translates into an increased synthesis and concentration. We hence propose that, in the context of size control, size-independent genes can act as gene-copy-number sensors. Beyond size regulation, the genes might encode proteins that need to be present in a fixed proportion to the genome content, e.g., transcription factors or histones. By contrast, size-dependent genes bind TM with lower affinity, such that their occupation by TM increases proportional to cell volume. Through this mechanism, their proteins can maintain a constant concentration until the gene is saturated. We propose that the majority of proteins uses this type of control, Cln3 being a concrete example [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to their characteristics, size-dependent genes share TM among themselves, such that an overall ploidy increase does not result in an increase in protein concentration. Size-dependent genes can hence act as sensors for the copy-number-to-ploidy ratio, the gene dosage. Variations of the affinity constants between the two extremes may lead to intermediate expression patterns, including genes that can switch from size-dependent to size-independent expression within a given range of cell sizes. We propose that this simple mechanism of gene expression operates alongside other forms of transcription control, which involves non-equilibrium processes and stochastic phenomena [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], to compensate for cell growth.</p><p>By incorporating the gene expression model into a model of the yeast cell cycle, we show that size-independent synthesis of the inhibitor Whi5 and size-dependent synthesis of the activator Cln3, a mechanism termed inhibitor dilution [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], can indeed establish size control at <sc>Start</sc>. It is important to note that, because Whi5 is a stoichiometric inhibitor of SBF without catalytic activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we have assumed in our inhibitor-dilution mechanism that Whi5 and SBF form a tightly bound complex. In addition, we assumed that phosphorylation of Whi5 by Cln3 breaks up the complex and liberates SBF. Considering that SBF maintains a constant concentration, as has been shown experimentally for one of its subunits [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Whi5 is therefore in fact countered by two size-dependent activators, Cln3 and SBF. Given these molecular interactions, our results suggest that, in the inhibitor-dilution paradigm, the rising number of SBF molecules in a growing cell eventually overcomes inhibition by exceeding the constant number of Whi5 molecules (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s010">S1 Text</xref> for details). Cln3 merely sets the threshold at which SBF activation occurs by keeping a fraction of Whi5 molecules in a phosphorylated (inactive) state. Because this fraction does not change appreciably with cell size, Cln3 is not directly involved in creating the size-dependent signal that facilitates <sc>Start</sc> in our version of the inhibitor-dilution model. Hence, between the inhibitor-dilution model and the titration-of-nuclear-sites mechanism there exists an intriguing symmetry, in which Whi5 and nuclear sites are very much alike. Both are constant in number and proportional to DNA content and both titrate away an activator. We also show that the gradual increase in SBF activity in response to cell volume growth that is caused by Whi5 dilution is converted into an all-or-nothing decision by a bistable switch located at <sc>Start</sc>. This switch is created by a positive feedback loop on SBF activity and it establishes a strict size threshold of <sc>Start</sc>. Hence, positive feedback and bistability are used to implement a size checkpoint in G1.</p><p>While inhibitor dilution is able to maintain size homeostasis and reproduce the size increase seen in diploid cells, it fails to explain why an increase in ploidy at a constant number of <italic>WHI5</italic> copies leads to larger cells. Such a change does not alter the expression of Whi5 and Cln3 and hence should not affect cell size at <sc>Start</sc>. Even the delay in S/G2/M progression observed experimentally [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] is unable to reproduce these size changes in our model, suggesting that ploidy influences cell size beyond an effect through Whi5 and Cln3 expression and S/G2/M duration. Such an effect could be mediated by an as-yet-unknown inhibitor of <sc>Start</sc> which is produced in a size-independent manner similar to Whi5. In this case, an increased expression of this inhibitor in diploid cells, due to a higher copy number of its gene, would cause the observed size increase. However, a much more appealing hypothesis is that the genome itself acts as an inhibitor of <sc>Start</sc>. In particular, the binding of SBF to a limited number of genomic sites, which was proposed based on experiments [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], essentially converts SBF into a variable that does not change in number with cell size, as only the SBF that is bound to the genome would affect the <sc>Start</sc> transition. Since the number of Whi5 molecules is constant as well, the amount of Whi5:SBF complexes, assuming tight binding between both, is not changing with cell size. However, the number of Cln3 molecules increases, such that Cln3 titrates against Whi5:SBF complexes on the genome. At a particular threshold size, Cln3 exceeds the number of Whi5:SBF complexes, leading to a sharp increase in free Cln3 that can trigger <sc>Start</sc>. Positive feedback is again used to convert this increase into an all-or-none decision. In this context, a diploid cell is larger because it contains twice the number of SBF binding sites, requiring more Cln3 molecules to trigger <sc>Start</sc>. Hence, the genome itself, through providing SBF binding sites that titrate Cln3, acts as a <sc>Start</sc> inhibitor, using a form of distributed control (binding sites distributed throughout the genome) instead of a single gene product such as Whi5. We show that this Cln3 titration model is consistent with <italic>WHI5</italic> and <italic>CLN3</italic> mutant phenotypes and with experiments in which additional SBF binding sites are expressed and consequently cell size at <sc>Start</sc> is increased [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also note that size-independent synthesis of Whi5 in the titration model is beneficial because increasing Whi5 production in large cells would impair their progress through <sc>Start</sc>, thereby compromising size control. Moreover, the proportional increase in Whi5 synthesis with gene copy number allows for a constant ratio between Whi5 and SBF molecules on binding sites in cells with increasing ploidy, providing an intriguing hypothesis for why Whi5 is synthesised in a size-independent manner.</p><p>A recent study of cell cycle commitment in buddy yeast called into question the dilution of Whi5, arguing instead that a size-dependent increase in the concentrations of G1/S transcription factors helps to set the size threshold for <sc>Start</sc> [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s009">S6 Fig</xref>, we show that such a model is indeed able to achieve size homeostasis but is incompatible with data on Whi5 synthesis rates and the size of some mutant strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006548.s011">S2 Text</xref> for details). Hence, our model in combination with careful measurements of not only protein concentrations but also protein synthesis rates and cell sizes in mutants could help to resolve such discrepancies.</p><p>In recent years, studies of bacterial size control have argued for an &#x02018;adder-type&#x02019; mechanism, whereby cells add a constant increment of cell mass per cycle [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A similar type of behaviour was found between two budding events in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Yet, it remained unclear whether cells actively sense the added mass and use this information to regulate cell cycle events, a scenario later referred to as a mechanistic adder [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. From our simulations, we indeed observe the presence of an adder over the whole cell cycle, with no correlation between the added cell mass and the volume at birth. However, this behaviour does not result from a direct mechanism, but rather from a combination of a mechanistic sizer in G1 and a mechanistic timer in S/G2/M, which is in excellent agreement with a recent study arguing that the adder phenomenon emerges from independent pre- and post-<sc>Start</sc> controls [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar to these and other experiments [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], our titration model shows an inverse proportionality between G1 length and birth size, and an imperfect sizer mechanism. We propose that adaptation is imperfect because of a volume-dependent distribution of Whi5. An ideal sizer, where <sc>Start</sc> size is independent of birth size, requires that each daughter cell receives a constant amount of Whi5. However, Whi5 complexes that diffuse freely in the nucleus or cytoplasm would be distributed based on the size of the daughter cell, with large cells receiving a larger increment of Whi5 that keeps them in G1 for longer. In our model, this results in a weak birth-size dependence of the <sc>Start</sc> threshold and imperfect size control. This might be one reason why cells do not rely on a pure inhibitor-dilution mechanism, which would exacerbate the influence of Whi5 distribution, but instead use a combination of Whi5 dilution and Cln3 titration. In addition, Cln3 is a highly unstable protein [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and thus provides a snapshot of the <underline>current</underline> transcriptional capacity and volume of a cell, while Whi5 was produced in the <underline>previous</underline> cycle, inevitably introducing some form of memory of past growth conditions.</p><p>In summary, our study provides a mechanistic model of gene expression and cell cycle regulation in budding yeast that readily shows size homeostasis. Since the control network of <sc>Start</sc> in budding yeast is structurally similar to restriction point control in mammalian cells, similar mechanisms could be at work during mammalian size control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Mathematical modelling</title><p>Our models for budding yeast size control comprise sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs describe the dynamics of genes and proteins in terms of their molecule number rather than concentration, which is used by most biochemical models that do not account for cell volume growth.

where <italic>Gr</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>Gr</italic><sub>d</sub> are binary variables that control whether growth is directed into the mother or daughter. These variables were introduced based on experimental observations suggesting that, during the budded period, volume growth primarily occurs in the bud and not the parent cell [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Note that during the budded period, the total cell volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>) comprises the volume of both mother and daughter.</p><p>In our model, cell cycle progression occurs through the expression of three types of cyclins: the G1 cyclins Cln3 (<italic>CLN</italic>3) and Cln1/2 (<italic>CLN</italic>), and the mitotic cyclins Clb1/2 (<italic>CLB</italic>).

Hence, at cell division, we assigned <italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub> to <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (the daughter becomes the new &#x02018;mother&#x02019; cell) and directed growth into the new cell. Moreover, the genome is split evenly, such that the new cell receives half of all gene-related variables. The remaining proteins are divided based on the volume ratio of mother and daughter cell before division (<italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>), assuming that these proteins can freely diffuse in the cytoplasm or nucleus. However, we assumed that all newly produced Whi5 is directed towards the daughter cell. This is consistent with experimental evidence showing a higher concentration of Whi5 in daughter cells compared to their mothers after division [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and with the fact that mother cells exhibit a short G1 phase [<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006548.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, as mother cells do not increase significantly in volume after <sc>Start,</sc> any newly produced Whi5 that remains in the mother cell would increase its Whi5 concentration above the previously passed threshold for <sc>Start</sc>, thus extending the &#x02018;old&#x02019; mother&#x02019;s next G1-phase and leading to further mother-cell growth. Also note that we assumed transcriptionally active genes rapidly adapt to the new concentration of TM and hence multiplied these variables by <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub> as well.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Titration of nuclear sites model</title><p>Our titration model is based on the principles of gene expression outlined above and largely employs the same equations than the inhibitor-dilution model.

First, Whi5 binds to SBF and forms a Whi5:SBF complex (<italic>WHISBF</italic>), which inhibits SBF activity. Subsequently, Cln3 can bind to form a trimeric Cln3:Whi5:SBF complex (<italic>CLN</italic>3<italic>WHISBF</italic>) in which Whi5 becomes hypo-phosphorylated, causing the dissociation of Cln3 and leaving a hypo-phosphorylated, but still inhibited, Whi5-P:SBF complex (<italic>WHIpSBF</italic>). This complex can either be dephosphorylated or hyper-phosphorylated by free Cln3, which liberates SBF and induces Cln1/2 expression.

Whi5 strongly binds to SBF in a concentration-based manner, causing SBF inhibition. Both free and complexed Whi5 can be phosphorylated by Cln3, Cln1/2 and Clb1/2. Phosphorylation of SBF:Whi5 complexes leads to their dissociation, which activates SBF. (<bold>B</bold>) Scheme of SBF inhibition in the titration model. Whi5 strongly binds to SBF, which occupies a fixed number of nuclear sites. Cln3 strongly binds to Whi5:SBF, slowly hypo-phosphorylating the complex and dissociating in the process. Hypo-phosphorylated Whi5:SBF can return to the unphosphorylated state. However, when free Cln3 or Cln1/2 are available, Whi5 becomes hyper-phosphorylated leading to Whi5 dissociation and SBF activation. Subsequently, the free pool of Whi5 is phosphorylated by Cln1/2. Note that in both models, active SBF drives the synthesis of Cln1/2, which accelerates Whi5 phosphorylation and SBF activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006548.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).
