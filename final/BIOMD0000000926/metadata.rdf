     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Abstract:
Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence suggest that the immune response to cancer is not exclusively anti-tumor. Indeed, the pro-tumor roles of the immune system - as suppliers of growth and pro-angiogenic factors or defenses against cytotoxic immune attacks, for example - have been long appreciated, but relatively few theoretical works have considered their effects. Inspired by the recently proposed &amp;quot;immune-mediated&amp;quot; theory of metastasis, we develop a mathematical model for tumor-immune interactions at two anatomically distant sites, which includes both anti- and pro-tumor immune effects, and the experimentally observed tumor-induced phenotypic plasticity of immune cells (tumor &amp;quot;education&amp;quot; of the immune cells). Upon confrontation of our model to experimental data, we use it to evaluate the implications of the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. We find that tumor education of immune cells may explain the relatively poor performance of immunotherapies, and that many metastatic phenomena, including metastatic blow-up, dormancy, and metastasis to sites of injury, can be explained by the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. Our results suggest that further work is warranted to fully elucidate the pro-tumor effects of the immune system in metastatic cancer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
