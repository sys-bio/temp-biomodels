These cyclic processes, however, behave distinctively in terms of their periods and phases in response to external influences such as light, temperature, nutrients, etc. Nevertheless, several links have been found between these two oscillators. Cell division cycles gated by the circadian clock have been observed since the late 1950s. On the other hand, ionizing radiation (IR) treatments cause cells to undergo a DNA damage response, which leads to phase shifts (mostly advances) in circadian rhythms. Circadian gating of the cell cycle can be attributed to the cell cycle inhibitor kinase Wee1 (which is regulated by the heterodimeric circadian clock transcription factor, BMAL1/CLK), and possibly in conjunction with other cell cycle components that are known to be regulated by the circadian clock (i.e., c-Myc and cyclin D1). It has also been shown that DNA damage-induced activation of the cell cycle regulator, Chk2, leads to phosphorylation and destruction of a circadian clock component (i.e., PER1 in <italic>Mus</italic> or FRQ in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying how DNA damage causes predominantly phase advances in the circadian clock remains unknown. In order to address this question, we employ mathematical modeling to simulate different phase response curves (PRCs) from either dexamethasone (Dex) or IR treatment experiments. Dex is known to synchronize circadian rhythms in cell culture and may generate both phase advances and delays. We observe unique phase responses with minimum delays of the circadian clock upon DNA damage when two criteria are met: (1) existence of an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism in addition to the time-delayed negative feedback loop in the clock system and (2) Chk2-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of PERs that are not bound to BMAL1/CLK.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Molecular components and mechanisms that connect cell cycle and circadian rhythms are important for the well-being of an organism. Cell cycle machinery regulates the progress of cell growth and division while the circadian rhythm network generates an &#x0223c;24 h time-keeping mechanism that regulates the daily processes of an organism (i.e. metabolism, bowel movements, body temperature, etc.). It is observed that cell divisions usually occur during a certain time window of a day, which indicated that there are circadian-gated cell divisions. Moreover, it's been shown that mice are more prone to develop cancer when certain clock genes are mutated resulting in an arrhythmic clock. Recently, a cell cycle checkpoint regulator, Chk2, was identified as a component that influences a core clock component and creates mostly phase advances (i.e., jet lags due to traveling east) in circadian rhythms upon DNA damage. This phase response with minimum delays is an unexpected result, and the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unknown. Our computational analyses of a mathematical model reveal two molecular criteria that account for the experimentally observed phase responses of the circadian clock upon DNA damage. These results demonstrate how circadian clock regulation by cell cycle checkpoint controllers provides another layer of complexity for efficient DNA damage responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms are periodic physiological events that recur about every 24 hours. The importance of circadian rhythms is well recognized in many different organisms' survival as well as in human physiology. Misregulations in circadian rhythms may lead to different conditions such as depression, familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), or insomnia, which largely impact our society <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Leloup1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

</p><p>The molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms began to become clear beginning with the discovery of the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) gene in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in 1971 <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Konopka1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and the <italic>frequency</italic> (<italic>frq</italic>) gene in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> in 1973 <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Feldman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Through analysis of the genetic variants of these genes, pieces of the clock's mechanism could be described. The consensus idea is that it involves interlocked feedback loops largely based on a transcription-translation related time-delayed negative feedback loop <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Dunlap1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Most of the genes encoding proteins involved in the mechanism of circadian rhythms have been found simply by screens aimed at cataloging the components or by analysis of the regulation of the components. Several studies of mathematical modeling and systems approaches helped further understanding of circadian rhythms in various organisms <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Gallego1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>One of the defining properties of circadian rhythms is the ability to phase shift upon a stimulus from external cues. This property allows organisms to adapt efficiently to the external environment. For example, a person traveling east to Europe from the U.S. will experience a jet-lag in the process to adapt advanced phase. Even a brief pulse of light may cause phase advances or delays depending on the timing and influence of the pulse <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pittendrigh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is intuitive to assume that a phase shifting agent will create both phase advances and delays depending on the timing and strength of the pulse by uniformly affecting molecular pathways in the circadian system <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It has been observed that 2 h treatments of Rat-1 fibroblasts with dexamethasone (Dex) result in large advances and delays (Type 0 resetting of the phase), possibly by inducing transcription of both <italic>rPer1</italic> and <italic>rPer2</italic>
<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Izumo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This Dex-dependent PRC is also observed in the NIH3T3-Bmal1-Luc-1 cells <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Nagoshi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. If the Dex-dependent induction of <italic>Per</italic> transcripts causes both phase advances and delays, we would also predict that DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of PERs by Chk2 <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Gery1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> would result in similar PRCs. Recent findings indicate that this prediction is wrong <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Upon experiencing DNA damage, the cell cycle machinery influences the circadian clock in such a way that creates predominantly phase advances in Rat-1 fibroblasts and mice <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, as well as in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>
<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These data strongly suggest that there is a conserved pathway across different species that affects the phase of the clock after DNA damage, and involves physical interactions of ATM and/or Chk2 with a core clock component (i.e. PER1 or FRQ) <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Gery1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of PER1 and FRQ <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The molecular mechanism for this unique phenomenon, however, remains unexplained.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the minimum criteria in the molecular network of circadian rhythms that simulate the above PRCs with tools of computational modeling. Theoretically, a time-delayed negative feedback is sufficient to create robust oscillations. Both cell cycle and circadian rhythms, however, contain both negative and positive feedbacks in their wiring networks. Positive feedback mechanisms are essential for proper eukaryotic cell divisions <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Novak1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> whereas their roles in circadian rhythms remain elusive. Recently, Tsai and colleagues indicated that a general function of positive feedbacks in different networks is to create tunable robustness in the system <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In our study, we address two questions 1) what is a molecular mechanism that accounts for Chk2-dependent PRC in circadian rhythms?, and 2) is the positive feedback mechanism necessary for the observed PRC? In the conditions that we have tested, we discovered that we can only simulate the Chk2-dependent PRC with predominantly phase advances when Chk2 only affects PERs that are not bound to BMAL1/CLK in the presence of an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism. Both conditions are required for proper simulations. Our study is the only in silico experiment to indicate the necessity of an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism in simulating specific phenotype in the circadian system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chk2-dependent differential degradation of PER creates predominantly phase advances upon DNA damage</title><p>We explored our simple mammalian circadian clock model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000384-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) from our previous work <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Zamborszky1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> to investigate whether we can simulate different PRCs from the Dex and IR treatment experiments <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Izumo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

It is, however, not trivial to simulate a PRC with mostly phase advances reproducing the phenotype from the IR treatment experiments <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

This PRC is qualitatively different than the PRC after DNA damage as there are no advances.

Our data, however, is qualitatively different as we do see small advances whereas Badura and colleagues did not observe any advances <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Badura1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This difference are possibly due to the following reasons: 1) Badura et al. administered a CKI&#x003b5; inhibitor not as a pulse (there was no removal of the drug after administration), and 2) it is possible that Chk2 and CKI&#x003b5; results in different types of phosphorylations which can lead to different consequences. We plan to further investigate this with an extended version of circadian clock module.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>An autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism is required for the observed PRC</title><p>Our simple model is adapted from Tyson and colleagues' earlier paper where both negative and positive feedbacks play essential roles in creating a robust oscillator <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Tyson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

They used four sets of parameters in order to investigate possible functions of multiple feedback loops in the circadian system. For our purposes, we concentrated in parameter sets 1 and 3. In the parameter set 1, robust oscillations of their model can arise from two different time-delayed negative feedback loops: PER-driven and PER/CRY-independent BMAL1/CLK-driven negative feedback loops. For this parameter set, they can generate an oscillator based on BMAL1/CLK-driven negative feedback loop in the absence of the PER-driven negative feedback loop. In the parameter set 3, they disabled the BMAL1/CLK-driven negative feedback loop making the system a PER/CRY-dependent single negative feedback oscillator. We did not explore parameter sets 2 and 4 because PER is not required for oscillations in parameter sets 2 and 4. The wiring network of Leloup and Goldbeter's model is significantly different from our model which consists of an intertwined dynamics between an essential autocatalytic positive feedback and time-delayed negative feedback <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Tyson2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>We incorporated Chk2-induced degradation of PER molecules that are not bound to BMAL1/CLK in the Leloup and Goldbeter's model.

First, we added an autocatalytic positive feedback in the parameter set 1 of Leloup and Goldbeter's model in a similar way as in our simple model. PER complexes are assumed to be more stable than PER monomers. To our surprise, we were not able to generate the PRCs with predominantly phase advances with differential degradations of PER complexes by Chk2 even with an added autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism (lane 5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000384-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Interestingly, we were able to simulate the observed asymmetric PRC with predominantly phase advances as we have observed in our simple model only when both the autocatalytic positive feedback and the differential effect of Chk2 on PERs were implemented in the absence of BMAL1/CLK-driven negative feedback loop (lane 6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000384-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that there exists an important dynamical relationship between negative feedback loops and an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>What are the implications of DNA damage-induced phase responses of the circadian clock to the cell cycle? We hypothesize that cells utilize various pathways for different timing events in response to DNA damage. The Chk2 kinase directly inhibits the progress of the cell cycle by phosphorylating and removing Cdc25C (a phosphatase that is antagonistic to Wee1 which activates cell proliferation) from the nucleus <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Matsuoka2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Moreover, the cell cycle machinery also employs Chk2 in order to provide an additional mechanism that helps to delay the cell cycle progress for extended time by indirectly increasing the level of Wee1 via the circadian network. We believe that the above sequential roles of Chk2 maximize the efficiency of DNA damage-induced delay. With our model, we show that premature degradation of PER, resulting in phase advances, causes early activation of BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000384-g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This creates an early transcriptional activation of the Wee1 (G2 inhibitor of the cell cycle) during the upcoming circadian cycle, which delays the cell cycle in the G2 phase. If the DNA damage-response induces large phase delays, it will generate a short-lived, transient increase of BMAL1, but a long delay in the activation of Wee1 by BMAL1/CLK for the upcoming circadian cycle. This late activation of Wee1 is probably not a desired result for an efficient DNA damage response.</p><p>Our model is simple and intuitive, and yet predicts a molecular mechanism that is responsible for the observed PRC. Our in silico experiments elucidate a molecular mechanism that accounts for Chk2-dependent phase advances and minimum delays of the circadian clock upon DNA damage. It seems counterintuitive to assume that Chk2 does not affect the PER that is in a complex with BMAL1/CLK. This may appear to prolong the repression on BMAL1, which will delay the activation of Wee1. However, due to the cyclic nature of the circadian clock, our simulations suggest that these unique Chk2-dependent phase responses are the best strategy for inducing large and prolonged induction of Wee1 by BMAL1/CLK, allowing extended time for the cell cycle to repair problems upon DNA damage. We propose that the cell cycle network is ingeniously wired with the circadian clock for an optimal response upon DNA damage. Previously, experimentalists showed that the functional circadian clock is important for optimum response to the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide or &#x003b3; radiation <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Gorbacheva1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. For example, reduced apoptosis is observed in m<italic>Per2</italic> deficient mice compared to wild-type mice upon &#x003b3; radiation, which resulted in tumorigenesis <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Based on these works, it can be assumed that DNA damage response is more efficient when the circadian clock is intact. We do not know, however, how the efficiency of DNA damage response is affected by the circadian clock. Hence, we suggest testing the efficiency of DNA damage response in the presence and absence of the circadian clock in both in cell culture (i.e. wild-type vs. <italic>cry<sup>ko</sup></italic>) as well as in vivo.</p><p>Another intriguing finding is the importance of the autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism in simulating the observed PRC upon DNA damage. Our simple model is adapted from Tyson and colleagues which implemented both negative and positive feedback mechanisms <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Tyson2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. DNA damage-induced PRCs with predominantly advances are lost upon removal of the positive feedback even with the differential degradation of PERs by Chk2. This observation is extended to the Leloup and Goldbeter's model <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Leloup2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Leloup3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We tested four different combinations of positive and negative feedback loops with two different sets of parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000384-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our findings confirm that the autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism is required to simulate DNA damage-induced PRCs. Our results elucidate three important points: (1) the role of the autocatalytic positive mechanism in the circadian system, (2) the wiring of different negative feedback loops, and (3) the interplay between positive and negative feedbacks in response to DNA damage. We acknowledge that there are multiple feedback loops in the circadian system <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Dunlap1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, it is essential to develop a more comprehensive model accounting detailed dynamics of different negative feedback loops in the clock network. Furthermore, it is important to experimentally verify autocatalytic positive feedback mechanisms in the context of circadian rhythms, the nonlinearity of negative feedback loops, and the possible interplay between the positive and negative feedback loops in the circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Circadian rhythm model</title><p>Our objective is to create a simple mammalian circadian clock model that accounts for different phase response curves (PRCs) observed from various experiments <xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Izumo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Oklejewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000384-Pregueiro1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For simplicity of the model, we only deal with PER protein and treat PER1, PER2, and PER3 as same proteins. CRY proteins (CRY1 and CRY2) are also part of core clock components that negatively regulate BMAL1/CLK. We do not consider, however, CRY proteins in this model for two reasons: (1) simplicity of the model, and (2) it is not yet known whether Chk2 phosphorylates and triggers degradation of CRY proteins as mPER1. We will include the function of CRY proteins in our future work. We assume that PERs exist in monomers (Clock Protein, CP), dimers (Clock Protein, CP<sub>2</sub>), and complex with the BMAL1/CLK (Transcription Factor, TF). We imagine that the BMAL1/CLK is inactive when bound to PER (Inactive Complex, IC) creating a negative feedback.
