In this theoretical study, we investigate how the complex circuitry of the p53 network allows for stochastic yet unambiguous cell fate decision-making. The proposed Markov chain model consists of the regulatory core and two subordinated bistable modules responsible for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The regulatory core is controlled by two negative feedback loops (regulated by Mdm2 and Wip1) responsible for oscillations, and two antagonistic positive feedback loops (regulated by phosphatases Wip1 and PTEN) responsible for bistability. By means of bifurcation analysis of the deterministic approximation we capture the recurrent solutions (i.e., steady states and limit cycles) that delineate temporal responses of the stochastic system. Direct switching from the limit-cycle oscillations to the &#x0201c;apoptotic&#x0201d; steady state is enabled by the existence of a subcritical Neimark&#x02014;Sacker bifurcation in which the limit cycle loses its stability by merging with an unstable invariant torus. Our analysis provides an explanation why cancer cell lines known to have vastly diverse expression levels of Wip1 and PTEN exhibit a broad spectrum of responses to DNA damage: from a fast transition to a high level of p53 killer (a p53 phosphoform which promotes commitment to apoptosis) in cells characterized by high PTEN and low Wip1 levels to long-lasting p53 level oscillations in cells having PTEN promoter methylated (as in, e.g., MCF-7 cell line).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cancers are diseases of signaling networks. Transcription factor p53 is a pivotal node of a network that integrates a variety of stress signals and governs critical processes of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Somewhat paradoxically, despite the fact that carcinogenesis is prevalently caused by p53 network malfunction, most of our knowledge about p53 signaling is based on cancer or immortalized cell lines. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model of intact p53 network to understand dynamics of non-cancerous cells and then dynamics of cancerous cells by introducing perturbations to the regulatory system. Cell fate decisions are enabled by the presence of interlinked feedback loops which give rise to a rich repertoire of behaviors. We explain and analyze by means of numerical simulations how the dynamical structure of the regulatory system allows for generating unambiguous single-cell fate decisions, also in the case when the cell population splits into an apoptotic and a surviving subpopulation. Perturbation analysis provides an explanation why cancer cell lines known to have vastly diverse expression levels of p53 regulators can exhibit a broad spectrum of responses to DNA damage.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>BH, MK, MNB and TL were financed by National Science Center (Poland) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncn.gov.pl">https://www.ncn.gov.pl</ext-link> grant 2014/13/B/NZ2/03840.

It serves as a node of a complex and extensive gene regulatory network that integrates a variety of stress signals. One of the most important ways of p53 activation is through DNA damage, which can be caused by, i.a., ionizing radiation (IR), UV radiation, hypoxia, heat shock, viral infection, or nutrient deprivation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Exposure to IR inflicts DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), the most critical DNA lesions, which when unrepaired can lead to genomic instability resulting in either cell death or DNA mutations that can propagate to subsequent cell generations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The p53 regulatory network provides mechanisms that suppress cell cycle until DNA is repaired or trigger apoptosis when DNA damage is too extensive to be repaired [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Unsurprisingly, mutations of the p53 gene (<italic>TP53</italic>) turn out to be the most frequent genetic changes in human cancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. About half of all human cancer cells carry a mutation in <italic>TP53</italic>. In many other cancers, the genes which encode components of the p53 regulatory pathway are mutated [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lack of functional p53 protein decreases the efficiency of DNA repair and allows mutated cells to evade apoptosis leading to the propagation of mutations and eventually to cancer development and progression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Various malfunctions of the p53 regulatory pathway are determinants of tumor aggressiveness and p53 pathway components have become targets in anticancer therapies [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The primary molecular function of p53 is the regulation of transcription [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It controls expression of numerous genes which encode proteins of contradictory roles: pro-survival, cell cycle-suppressing, or pro-apoptotic [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Its ability to regulate expression of distinct sets of genes is controlled by posttranslational modifications [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, p53 can assume two different phosphorylation states: p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> (when it is phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser20 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> (when it is additionally phosphorylated at Ser46 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). In the arrester state, p53 triggers transcription of its main inhibitor, E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], cell cycle-suppressing protein p21 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and pro-survival phosphatase Wip1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the killer state, p53 triggers transcription of pro-apoptotic phosphatase PTEN [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and another pro-apoptotic protein, Bax [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In unstressed cells p53 remains inactive and is kept at a low level through constant proteasome-mediated degradation, regulated by Mdm2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. p53 is activated by kinase ATM, which is rapidly phosphorylated in response to DNA damage [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The DNA damage detection system is sensitive; a handful of DSBs is sufficient for ATM and p53 activation; 1 Gy of irradiation induces about 35&#x02013;40 DSBs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. ATM phosphorylates p53 at several residues, including Ser15 and Ser20, leading to its stabilization and activation as a transcription factor [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. ATM phosphorylates also p53 inhibitor, Mdm2, promoting its degradation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As a result, p53 concentration increases 3&#x02013;10-fold within an hour after DNA damage [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Activity of p53 can be suppressed by growth factor stimulation leading to the activation of PI3 kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into trisphosphate (PIP3) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. PIP3 allows for Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane where it can be activated via phosphorylation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] by several kinases. Activated Akt phosphorylates Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser186, allowing for its translocation to the nucleus where Mdm2 ubiquitinates p53 priming it for degradation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The p53-regulated proteins comprise a complex regulatory network governed by multiple intertwined feedback loops spanning diverse time scales [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition to the primary p53 inhibitor, Mdm2, other key regulatory players in the network are two phosphatases: pro-survival Wip1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and pro-apoptotic PTEN [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Wip1 attenuates signaling by dephosphorylating ATM [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and inhibits apoptosis by facilitating dephosphorylation of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> to the p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> form [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. When DNA repair is accomplished, Wip1 enables the return to the pre-stress state [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. PTEN mediates a positive feedback loop by inhibiting Akt and Mdm2, and by allowing p53<sub>KILLER</sub> to rise to a high level and initiate apoptosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can occur as a consequence of gene amplification, gene loss, promoter methylation, or mutations which alter protein function. Gene amplification or inhibition are the major mechanisms which enhance expression of genes involved in cancer development and progression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In particular, Wip1 amplification and overexpression have been found in multiple human cancers, predominantly in those that retain functional p53 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] such as breast, lung, pancreas, bladder, and liver cancer, and in neuroblastomas [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Conversely, Wip1-knockout mice are partially resistant to oncogene-induced cancer development, indicating that the inhibition of Wip1 activity may be potentially beneficial for cancer therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Decreased PTEN expression has been found in prostate, kidney, breast, bladder cancers, and in glioblastoma [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Cell lines with defective PTEN have alterations in the cell cycle regulation and a defective apoptotic response, which places PTEN among the tumor suppressors most commonly lost in human cancers. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type PTEN in cancer cells induces apoptosis and blocks cell-cycle progression [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Another dysregulated protein observed in many cancers is PI3K. The amplification of PI3K gene have been found in colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular, thyroid, breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, and in glioblastoma and acute leukemia [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>The clinical data shows that differences between cancer cells can be partially explained by different expression levels of PTEN, Wip1, and PI3K. The majority of breast cancers reveals amplification of Wip1 and reduced level of PTEN, which appear to correlate with poor prognosis as well as increased resistance to &#x003b3; radiation-based therapy and apoptosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>A number of computational models have been constructed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the p53 pathway. Earlier models were focused on explaining the origin of oscillations of p53 and Mdm2 levels in response to IR [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], which were first observed in the cell population experiment on MCF-7 cells by Bar-Or et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and later in single-cell experiments by Lahav et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and Geva-Zatorsky et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Recently, the effort has been shifted to connecting p53 dynamics with cell fate decisions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. For the sake of conciseness of the Introduction, an overview of p53 modeling results cited in this paragraph is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004787.s001">S1 Text</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the p53 regulatory core to demonstrate that the structure of the p53 regulatory network is such that for a broad range of parameters at persistent DNA damage the limit cycle oscillations of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> (as well as p53<sub>KILLER</sub>) coexist with the steady state characterized by a high level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub>. The detailed bifurcation analysis shows that the direct switch between oscillations and high steady state is enabled by the existence of a Neimark&#x02014;Sacker bifurcation. These two recurrent solutions delineate temporal responses of the system, which can be interpreted unambiguously by two slaved modules which control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

DNA damage leads to the activation of ATM. Active ATM phosphorylates p53 inhibitor, Mdm2, priming it for faster degradation. It also stabilizes and activates p53 by phosphorylating it to one of its active phosphoforms, p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>. This phosphoform can be further phosphorylated (at Ser46) to the p53<sub>KILLER</sub> form. p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> induces synthesis of Mdm2 and Wip1, a phosphatase which dephosphorylates ATM as well as p53<sub>KILLER</sub> to the p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> form.</p><p>p53<sub>KILLER</sub> activates expression of another phosphatase, PTEN, which mediates the slow positive feedback loop which stabilizes the level of p53. PTEN indirectly suppresses Akt catalytic activity, which is required to phosphorylate Mdm2 in order to enable its nuclear import. As a result, accumulation of PTEN leads to the accumulation of Mdm2 in cytoplasm and therefore physically disconnects nuclear p53 from its inhibitor, leading to the stabilization of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> and p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> at high levels. PTEN action is opposed by the growth and survival factors which lead to Akt activation.</p><p>Cell cycle arrest module is controlled by p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>. This phosphoform activates transcription of p21 which suppresses cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin E (CycE). The apoptotic module is controlled by p53<sub>KILLER</sub>, which activates transcription of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and by Akt, which suppresses the apoptosis by phosphorylation of 14-3-3 protein.</p><p>Among more than ten feedbacks present in the system the following four are of key functional importance:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>F1</bold> Negative feedback p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> &#x02192; Mdm2 &#x02013;| p53: p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> activates transcription of Mdm2 which ubiquitinates p53 inducing its rapid degradation.

As shown experimentally in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and demonstrated in analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004787.s003">S2 Fig</xref> the system without the negative feedback to ATM does not exhibit oscillations. The two positive feedbacks, F3 and F4, introduce bistability. These two feedbacks, mediated by Wip1 and PTEN phosphatases, act antagonistically. The Wip1-mediated loop (F3) prevents p53<sub>KILLER</sub> accumulation (by dephosphorylating p53<sub>KILLER</sub> to p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>) while the PTEN-mediated loop (F4) &#x0201c;supports&#x0201d; p53<sub>KILLER</sub> accumulation (by indirect inhibition of Mdm2). The PTEN loop results from double negation and involves several intermediates (PTEN, PIP2/PIP3, Akt, Mdm2), therefore its dynamics is slower. As a result, even in cells with extensive DNA damage, p53<sub>KILLER</sub> accumulation (and thus apoptosis) is postponed, granting the cell time which can be used for DNA repair. When DNA repair is accomplished before signal passes through the PTEN loop, the cell survives. However, when the DNA damage is severe so that its repair takes longer time, the PTEN-mediated feedback takes over and the cell commits to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Cell cycle arrest module</title><p>p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> induces expression of p21, a protein which suppresses cell cycle progression to allow for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). p21 directly binds and suppresses CycE which plays a critical role in the transition from G1 to S phase, and is considered a marker of cell cycle progression in the model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. CycE, synthesis of which is positively regulated by E2F1 (and several other transcription factors from the E2F family), can inactivate Rb1 protein by inducing its phosphorylation at Ser780. Phosphorylated Rb1 can no longer inhibit E2F1. This creates a positive feedback loop (based on double negation) in which CycE suppresses the inhibitor of its own transcription factor. This mode of regulation introduces bistability and allows for switch-like exit from and return to the cell cycle progression. Cell cycle progresses at a low level of p21 (i.e., when most of CycE is free). As p21 level increases the fraction of free CycE decreases, leading to dephosphorylation of Rb1 and inhibition of E2F1. At some level of p21 the system rapidly transits to the state in which most of E2F1 is inhibited and the level of CycE is close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi.1004787.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004787.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Scheme and the bifurcation diagram for the cell cycle arrest module.</title><p>(A) Scheme: cell cycle-arresting proteins are represented with green boxes, proteins promoting cell cycle with blue boxes, other proteins or complexes with gray boxes.

This is possible because the other pro-apoptotic protein, Bad, that can bind Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, remains phosphorylated by Akt<sub>p</sub> and sequestered by pro-survival protein 14-3-3. Dephosphorylation of Akt (which is considered here as pro-apoptotic signal) leads to the dephosphorylation of Bad and its release from the complex with 14-3-3. Subsequently, Bad binds to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> displacing Bax, which accumulates in the mitochondrial membrane, leading eventually to the release of cytochrome c, which initiates caspase activation (active both initiator and executioner caspases are collectively denoted as Casp). In the model, the step of cytochrome c release is omitted; instead, we assume that Bax activates Casp directly. The other pro-apoptotic signal comes from p53<sub>KILLER</sub>, accumulation of which triggers Bax transcription and Bax protein accumulation.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3B</xref> we analyze how cell fate decisions depend on the levels of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> and Akt<sub>p</sub>. In the (p53<sub>KILLER</sub>, Akt<sub>p</sub>)-plane the saddle&#x02014;node bifurcations line separates the region where survival coexists with apoptosis from the apoptotic region. The transition from survival to apoptosis requires crossing the saddle&#x02014;node line, that is possible only when the level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> increases and, simultaneously, a fraction of phosphorylated Akt (Akt<sub>p</sub>) drops. Therefore, the apoptotic module integrates information about Akt<sub>p</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> levels in the way similar to the AND logic gate (meaning that simultaneous dephosphorylation of Akt and build-up of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> are needed to trigger apoptosis). In our previous study [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], we demonstrated that the system can behave digitally, either as the logic gate AND, or as the logic gate OR, depending on the levels of Bad and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. Gate AND arises for high levels of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and low levels of Bad. The OR gate (when apoptosis may be initiated by one of the two apoptotic signals) arises for high Bad and low Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> levels.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref> we show bifurcation diagrams of the apoptotic switch with p53<sub>KILLER</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and Akt<sub>p</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) considered bifurcation parameters. The model predicts that for Akt<sub>p</sub> = 0 and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> &#x0003c; 10<sup>5</sup> the cell can exist either in the apoptotic or in surviving steady state, characterized by a high and a low Casp levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). At p53<sub>KILLER</sub> &#x02248; 10<sup>5</sup> the system undergoes the saddle&#x02014;node bifurcation (in which Casp &#x02248; 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>) in which the surviving state vanishes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3D</xref> we show that for a high level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> (i.e., p53<sub>KILLER</sub> &#x02248; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) the system exhibits bistability for Akt<sub>p</sub> &#x0003e; 4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>.

The bifurcation diagrams shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref> imply that the caspase activation switch (in contrast to the cell cycle arrest switch) is irreversible, i.e., there is no possibility to return from the apoptotic to the surviving state (even after p53<sub>KILLER</sub> drops to zero or Akt<sub>p</sub> grows to its maximal value). The structure of the bifurcation diagram of Casp vs. p53<sub>KILLER</sub> resembles qualitatively the bifurcation diagram of Casp vs. Bax analyzed in our earlier work [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Bifurcation analysis of the p53 core module</title><p>In this section we focus on the discrimination of possible responses to DNA damage. In the bifurcation analysis we assume that the number of DSBs remains constant and equal to 100, which is considered as severe DNA damage. Bifurcation analysis allows us to determine the recurrent solutions (i.e., steady states and limit cycles) that delineate time-dependent responses to DNA damage. Since the two positive feedback loops are controlled by phosphatases Wip1 and PTEN, expression levels of which are varied substantially among cancer cells, we choose Wip1 and PTEN synthesis rates as bifurcation parameters. Additionally, PTEN has slow dynamics with respect to the other components and its gradual accumulation after DNA damage controls the behavior of the whole system. As a result, the system behavior can be predicted by bifurcation analysis in which PTEN is a bifurcation parameter.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g004">Fig 4</xref> we show the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram in the (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>)-plane, where s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub> are Wip1 and PTEN synthesis rates, respectively. As shown, the system involves three types of bifurcations: Hopf, saddle-node, and Neimark&#x02014;Sacker. In the 2-D diagram, Neimark&#x02014;Sacker bifurcations line arises at one zero&#x02014;Hopf point (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>) &#x02248; (0.1, 0.012) and vanishes at another zero&#x02014;Hopf point (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>) &#x02248; (0.3, 0.053). Between these points the Hopf bifurcations are supercritical, while outside them they are subcritical. The supercritical Hopfs line lies between the saddle&#x02014;node line and the Neimark&#x02014;Sacker bifurcations line. The saddle&#x02014;node lines arise in a cusp point (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>) &#x02248; (0.02, 0.001). The bifurcation lines divide the (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>)-plane into subregions in which the system exhibits different behaviors. In short, the system is oscillatory in the parameter subdomain to the right of the Hopf bifurcations line, i.e., oscillations can arise due either increase of Wip1 synthesis or decrease of PTEN synthesis. The bistability (understood here as either the coexistence of two stable steady states or coexistence of one stable steady state and one stable limit cycle) can arise between two saddle&#x02014;node lines.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004787.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004787.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Two-dimensional bifurcation diagram showing various types of bifurcation lines and points in the (Wip1 synthesis rate, PTEN synthesis rate)-plane.</title><p>The black dot indicates nominal values of parameters <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>.

The antagonism of PI3K and PTEN is straightforward because PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, while PTEN dephosphorylated PIP3 to PIP2.

According to the bifurcation diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g004">Fig 4</xref>) for the nominal parameters values, upon persistent DNA damage the system possesses the unique stable steady state.

For these parameters, as shown in the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g004">Fig 4</xref>, the system possesses a unique stable recurrent solution, the limit cycle. Accordingly, as we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> exhibit sustained oscillations of period of about 6 hours.

Here, the process is more complex as the repair of DNA may rescue cells from apoptosis. In this case the cell fate depends on the irradiation dose, and is decided through the competition between two processes: DNA repair and accumulation of PTEN which controls positive feedback-regulating levels of active Akt and p53<sub>KILLER</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, small DNA damage resulting from 2-Gy irradiation can be almost fully repaired in about 20 hours, thus the apoptosis is not initiated.

DNA damage leads to a rapid ATM phosphorylation and activation. Activated ATM phosphorylates p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 to the p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> form, which accumulates and induces synthesis of p53 inhibitor, Mdm2, and phosphatase Wip1 which dephosphorylates ATM. These two negative feedback loops (mediated by Mdm2 and Wip1) lead to oscillations of the level of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and levels of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>-regulated proteins, including p21. Increased level of p21 leads to the inhibition of CycE and transient cell cycle arrest, during which DNA can be repaired.</p><p>p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> can be subsequently phosphorylated at Ser46 to the p53<sub>KILLER</sub> form by HIPK2 (a kinase which accumulates in response to DNA damage; see detailed scheme of the model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004787.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). This process is opposed by Wip1 which converts p53<sub>KILLER</sub> back to the p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> form. As a result, the level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> oscillates not surpassing the apoptotic threshold. After, about 20 h, when DNA repair is accomplished, ATM is deactivated and oscillations of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> and p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> are terminated. Subsequently, the level of p21 drops below the threshold (bifurcation point SN<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), CycE returns to its initial level, and cell cycle progression is resumed.</p><p>In the case of extensive DNA damage caused by 10-Gy irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) DNA repair requires more time. Although initial regulatory events are similar to those at 2-Gy irradiation, prolonged p53<sub>KILLER</sub> activity induces accumulation of PTEN to a higher level, such that PTEN-mediated positive feedback loop terminates oscillations by sequestering Mdm2 in the cytoplasm, which separates it from its substrate, nuclear p53. Namely, accumulation of PTEN leads to dephosphorylation of Akt (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004787.s002">S1 Fig</xref> for details) and subsequent dephosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser166 and Ser186, which blocks its nuclear entry and physically separates it from its target, p53. Of note, the positive feedback loop mediated by Wip1 (which stabilizes p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>) and the one mediated by PTEN (which stabilizes p53<sub>KILLER</sub>) act antagonistically. In the case of extensive DNA damage, the slow PTEN-mediated positive feedback can ultimately take over, causing the surge of the level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> which ultimately surpasses the apoptosis-inducing threshold. Importantly, since early hours after DNA damage till (and throughout) apoptosis, the cell cycle remains suspended, preventing proliferation of cells which have lost their genomic integrity.</p><p>In summary, small DNA damage leads to a temporal cell cycle arrest during which DNA is repaired, while extensive DNA damage leads to the cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Regulation of the core p53 module (see the bifurcation diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is such that in the oscillatory phase the level of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> is high enough to suppress cell cycle but the level of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> does not exceed the apoptotic threshold. Only in the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; steady state levels of phosphorylated Akt and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> exceed the apoptotic threshold. This type of regulation assures that the cell fate decision is unanimous.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Impact of Wip1 and PTEN expression levels on the sensitivity to irradiation</title><p>As shown in the previous subsection, in response to irradiation the cell can either undergo apoptosis or repair its DNA and survive.

Here, we analyze how Wip1 and PTEN mRNA synthesis rates s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub>, and the level of active PI3K influence the critical irradiation dose. Level of active PI3K depends on the total level of PI3K which is cell line-dependent and can increase in response to various stimuli including growth factors. Gene copy amplification and overexpression of PI3K have been found in several types of cancer, including gastric (SNU1), prostate (LNCaP), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ovarian (OVCAR4) and breast (MCF-12A, MB157) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

This relationship follows from the fact that PTEN and PI3K has directly opposing roles in the pathway.</p><p>Overall, our analysis indicates that cellular proclivity for irradiation-induced apoptosis increases with PTEN to Wip1 expression ratio, and decreases with the level of active PI3K. This confirms the pro-survival role of Wip1 and PI3K, and the pro-apoptotic role of PTEN. Since cancer cell lines have diverse expression levels of Wip1, PTEN and PI3K, they are expected to exhibit divergent responses to irradiation; therefore, different cancers may have widely varying sensitivity to radiotherapy. In particular, the performed analysis explains high survival rates of irradiated MCF-7 cells for which the expression of Wip1 is significantly increased while PTEN expression is reduced.

In the figure we show trajectories of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> in response to three irradiation doses: small of 2 Gy, intermediate of 4 Gy (which is just below the critical dose for the deterministic approximation) and large of 8 Gy. As one can observe, the stochastic trajectories follow closely the deterministic trajectory for the low and high doses, and in these two cases the population trajectory almost matches the deterministic one. This is in contrast to the intermediate dose of 4 Gy, for which the deterministic trajectory after a few oscillations (during which DNA is repaired) returns to the initial state characterized by low levels of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub>, while the stochastic trajectories separate into two groups corresponding to the apoptotic cells (of high p53 levels) and surviving cells (of low p53 levels). As a result, for 4 Gy the deterministic trajectory is much different from the population-averaged trajectory. Such discrepancy between deterministic and stochastic solutions has been demonstrated earlier for various, even very simple, nonlinear or multistable systems [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. It is especially pronounced in the cases of bistable (or multistable) systems when the deterministic trajectory converges to one of steady states, while the stochastic trajectories split into two (or more) groups.

The number of DSBs that arise during the irradiation phase (which, due to the stochasticity, can be different for cells irradiated with the same dose) is the fastest predictor. PTEN and Akt<sub>u</sub> (levels of which can be different prior to the irradiation due to stochastic fluctuations in resting cells) are also fast predictors and, moreover, the Kolmogorov&#x02014;Smirnov statistics corresponding to their distributions grow monotonically. This is in contrast to p53<sub>KILLER</sub>, p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>, and Wip1 levels, which exhibit pronounced oscillations after irradiation, and for which the Kolmogorov&#x02014;Smirnov statistics reach 1 non-monotonously.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004787.g011" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004787.g011</object-id><label>Fig 11</label><caption><title>Analysis of the cell fate decision-making process.</title><p>(A) PTEN levels in subpopulations of surviving (blue) and apoptotic (red) cells after 4-Gy irradiation. 10 000 cells are simulated in total.

Based on the experimental knowledge about feedbacks and interactions within the p53 network, we proposed a modular model of p53 signaling pathway, in which the dynamics of the core p53 module controls downstream modules that govern cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The model has the purposeful bifurcation structure that delineates plausible temporal responses and allows for, we think, the most unambiguous cell death, cycle arrest, or survival decisions.</p><p>The stochastic, yet unambiguous, processing of analog irradiation signals to reach a digital cell fate outcome is assured by the bistability of cell cycle arrest and apoptotic modules, but primarily by a specific-type bistability of the core p53 module. As demonstrated by the two-parameter bifurcation analysis of the core module, in a relatively broad range of parameters the limit cycle oscillations (of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> levels) coexist with the stable steady state in which the p53<sub>KILLER</sub> level is very high, while the level of phosphorylated Akt is very low. The limit cycle oscillations of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> induce cell cycle arrest, while the high p53<sub>KILLER</sub> level and low level of phosphorylated Akt induce apoptosis. The key difference between dynamics of the cycle arrest module and the apoptotic module is that the former is based on reversible bistability and involves one input signal, p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub>, which suppresses cell cycle when above the threshold and releases the cell cycle arrest when below the lower threshold. In turn, apoptosis induction requires two signals (increase of p53<sub>KILLER</sub> and decrease of phosphorylated Akt) simultaneously, and is an irreversible process.</p><p>The bifurcation structure delineates temporal responses to DNA damage. Small DNA damage results in temporal cell cycle arrest, followed by DNA repair and return to the resting cell state, while high DNA damage results in the cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis (without returning to cell cycle). The direct jump between limit cycle oscillations and the stable steady state is enabled by the presence of a subcritical Neimark&#x02014;Sacker bifurcation in which the limit cycle loses its stability merging with an unstable invariant torus. Interestingly, this type of bifurcation, rarely analyzed in the context of molecular regulatory networks, can exist in at least three-dimensional systems. Although the core module is 18-dimensional, the stability analysis of the steady state showed that at most three eigenvalues have positive real parts which implies that locally the system could be reduced to a three-dimensional one. It remains an open question whether such reduction is possible globally.</p><p>We propose that in the process of cell fate decision-making the p53 system can exhibit the most robust transitions when the only stable recurrent solutions are a stable limit cycle and a stable steady state (out of this limit cycle), provided there exists a parameter region for which these recurrent solutions coexist. Such structure allows cells to switch to the cell cycle arrest (associated in the model with limit-cycle oscillations of the levels of p53 phosphoforms) and then to direct transition to either apoptosis or recovery. Interestingly, there exists an even simpler bifurcation structure, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004787.s006">S5 Fig</xref>, that allows for such transitions. In this hypothetical case, as the bifurcation parameter s<sub>2</sub> increases the limit cycle simply vanishes in the saddle&#x02014;loop bifurcation. The most pronounced dynamical difference between the modeled and the hypothetical scenario is that the period of oscillations diverges to infinity as the bifurcation parameter approaches the saddle&#x02014;loop bifurcation point. This would imply that in a heterogeneous cellular population some cells would exhibit much longer oscillation periods, which is not observed in experiments [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As discussed by us earlier [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], we thus expect that oscillations in the p53 system (as well as in the NF-&#x003ba;B system) do not arise or vanish through a saddle&#x02014;loop bifurcation or a saddle&#x02014;node on invariant cycle bifurcation (also called SNIPER) in which limit cycle arises from orbit homoclinic to the saddle.</p><p>Biochemical signal processing depends on the topology and time scales of feedback loops. Regulatory networks with negative feedback(s) can produce oscillatory or pulsed responses to tonic stimuli, and allow for adaptation to the change in the level of stimulation. The existence of positive feedbacks, in turn, can give rise to bistability [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] (or multistability [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]) that can be harnessed for cell fate decisions. Combinations of positive and negative feedbacks allow for more complex behaviors. At least three qualitatively different type of responses leading to distinct regulatory outcomes are possible. (1) In the case when a positive feedback loop acts on a short time scale and is embedded in a longer negative feedback loop, the system can switch periodically between two predefined states (e.g., the autophagy/translation switch [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]). (2) In the case when a positive feedback loops encompasses the negative one, the system can exhibit autonomous oscillations (e.g., oscillations in the TNF&#x02014;NF-&#x003ba;B autocrine system [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]). (3) In the case when a slow positive feedback loop can turn off a negative feedback, the system can exhibit biphasic responses in which after an oscillatory phase it either returns to the initial state (more likely when the signal is short-lasting) or it switches to another steady state (more likely when the signal is persistent or lasts sufficiently long [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]). The last case (which is a simplification of the p53 regulatory core organization discussed in this study) seems to be a good candidate for the unbiased and proportionate process of cell fate decisions. The oscillatory phase provides a time interval to collect and integrate various signals, and estimate the severity of stress, before a (potentially irreversible) switch to another committed state is done.</p><p>Stochastic simulations of the model allowed to analyze how the death-or-life decision is achieved in time, and what are the best or earliest indicators of apoptosis. By calculating time-dependent Kolmogorov&#x02014;Smirnov statistic between distributions of protein levels corresponding to two populations of cells with apoptotic and surviving fates, we found that the clear separation between these two populations is reached at about 30 hours after irradiation. PTEN, the p53-induced phosphatase that mediates slow positive feedback loop, was found to be the most robust and fast apoptosis predictor. Interestingly, the Kolmogorov&#x02014;Smirnov statistics for Wip1, p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> are non-monotonous in time, what possibly follows from the pronounced oscillations of these components and indicates that at some time-points of the response the elevated or decreased levels of pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins may not correlate with the ultimate cell fate decision.</p><p>Most of experimental data were gathered for cancer (or immortalized) cell lines, which became cancerous as a result of malfunctions in the p53 network. Much less is known about regulation of normal, i.e., non-cancer, non-immortalized cells. Nevertheless, we expect that the plausible responses of normal cells should consist of the cell cycle suppression phase (which can be associated with p53 oscillations), followed by either apoptosis or recovery, depending on the extent of the DNA damage. Accordingly, in contrast to the majority of previous studies focused on modeling of cancer cell lines, we aimed at constructing the model that reflects behavior of normal cells after &#x003b3; irradiation. Within this model, the responses of different cancer cell lines can be analyzed by adjusting the appropriate parameters such as mRNA synthesis rates or steady-state levels of proteins that are assumed to be not regulated in the model. In this way one can simulate cancer cell lines that are known to have elevated expression of Wip1 such as MCF-7, BT474 (breast cancers), OVCAR4 (ovarian cancer), MOLT4 (lymphoma), U2OS (osteosarcoma) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], lines of decreased PTEN expression such as MCF-7 (breast cancer), H1299, H322, Calu1 (lung cancers) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], or with amplification of PI3K gene, such as MKN1, SNU1 (gastric cancers), OVCAR4, A2780 (ovarian cancers) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>The life-or-death decision is reached in the interplay of two antagonistic phosphatases Wip1 and PTEN. Our analysis shows that sensitivity to apoptosis increases with PTEN expression and decreases with Wip1 or PI3K expression, which confirms the pro-survival functions of Wip1 and PI3K, and pro-apoptotic functions of PTEN. The other key regulatory pro-apoptotic protein present in network is kinase HIPK2 that converts p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> to the p53<sub>KILLER</sub> phosphoform [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The model shows that undamped oscillations of p53<sub>ARRESTER</sub> and p53<sub>KILLER</sub> levels observed in MCF-7 cells can result from the low expression of PTEN. Analogously, our analysis indicates that cell lines with Wip1 overexpression (resulting from, e.g., gene amplification) can exhibit persistent oscillations and resistance to apoptosis. Strong dependence of the critical irradiation dose on PTEN, Wip1, and PI3K expression may suggest that pretreatment of cancer cells (with intact p53) with drugs that act temporally to elevate the expression of PTEN or to repress the expression of Wip1 or PI3K can enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy.</p><p>Very recently, Puszy&#x00144;ski et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] have modified his earlier model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] to study the responses of the p53 network to nutlins, promising antitumor chemical agents which bind to a p53-binding pocket of Mdm2 and thus hinder Mdm2 from ubiquitinating p53. Puszy&#x00144;ski et al. demonstrated <italic>in silico</italic> that dose-splitting can be ineffective at low doses but effective at high doses, which can be attributed to nonlinear behavior of the regulatory system, manifested by the fact that a certain p53 threshold has to be exceeded to induce apoptosis. We propose that the current model can be used to study combination therapies involving agents which reduce the expression or inhibit the activity of Wip1, Mdm2, PI3K, together with ionizing radiation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004787.g012">Fig 12</xref> we survey over agents known to inhibit the selected nodes of the p53 pathway as well as DNA-damaging compounds that can be used in place of irradiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004787.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The proposed model provides the opportunity to investigate responses of particular cancer types, for which the anomalies in expression of p53 inhibitors are characterized. The aim is to propose a treatment that would reduce the levels or activity of Wip1, Mdm2, PI3K in cancer cells to make them more sensitive to radiotherapy, and to devise optimal drug and irradiation protocols that would leverage the impact of inhibitors by synchronizing their administration with the induced DNA damage.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004787.g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004787.g012</object-id><label>Fig 12</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic agents targeting the p53 regulatory core.</title><p>A selection of chemical compounds, both clinically approved chemotherapeutic drugs and newly discovered inhibitors, are shown.
