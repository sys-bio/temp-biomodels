  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <br/>
          The molecular machinery of cell cycle control is known in more detail for
budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, than for any other eukaryotic organism.
In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the
roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1-3 and Clb1-6) in coordinating the events of DNA
synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell
separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal
molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using
standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set
of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major
classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the
molecular events controlling &quot;Start&quot; (the commitment step to a new round of
chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and &quot;Finish&quot; (the transition
from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud
separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model
accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell
cycle control in budding yeast.      </p>
