Abstract:<br/>
Under the narrow range of experimental conditions, and at a temperature of approximately 25 degrees, the following data were obtained. 1. The equilibrium constant of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide has a minimum value of 2 x 10(-8). 2. The velocity constant for the formation of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I is 1.2 x 10(7) liter mole-1 sec.-1, +/- 0.4 x 10(7). 3. The velocity constant for the reversible breakdown of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I is a negligible factor in the enzyme-substrate kinetics and is calculated to be less than 0.2 sec.-1. 4. The velocity constant, k3, for the enzymatic breakdown of peroxidase-H2O2 Complex I varies from nearly zero to higher than 5 sec.-1, depending upon the acceptor and its concentration. The quotient of k3 and the leucomalachite green concentration is 3.0 x 10(4) liter mole-1 sec.-1. For ascorbic acid this has a value of 1.8 x 10(5) liter mole-1 sec.-1. 5. For a particular acceptor concentration, k3 is determined solely from the enzyme-substrate kinetics and is found to be 4.2 sec.-1. 6. For the same conditions, k3 is determined from a simple relationship derived from mathematical solutions of the Michaelis theory and is found to be 5.2 sec.-1. 7. For the same conditions, k3 is determined from the over-all enzyme action and is found to be 5.1 sec.-1. 8. The Michaelis constant determined from kinetic data alone is found to be 0.44 x 10(-6). 9. The Michaelis constant determined from steady state measurements is found to be 0.41 x 10(-6). 10. The Michaelis constant determined from measurement of the overall enzyme reaction is found to be 0.50 x 10(-6). 11. The kinetics of the enzyme-substrate compound closely agree with mathematical solutions of an extension of the Michaelis theory obtained for experimental values of concentrations and reaction velocity constants. 12. The adequacy of the criteria by which experiment and theory were correlated has been examined critically and the mathematical solutions have been found to be sensitive to variations in the experimental conditions. 13. The critical features of the enzyme-substrate kinetics are Pmax, and curve shape, rather than t1/2. t1/2 serves as a simple measure of dx/dt. 14. A second order combination of enzyme and substrate to form the enzyme-substrate compound, followed by a first order breakdown of the compound, describes the activity of peroxidase for a particular acceptor concentration. 15. The kinetic data indicate a bimolecular combination of acceptor and enzyme-substrate compound.
