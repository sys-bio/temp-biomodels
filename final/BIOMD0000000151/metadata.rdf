    dc:description """<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The model reproduces Fig 2 , Fig3A and Fig 3B of the paper. The ODE for x1(gp180) and x3 (gp 130)  is wrong and the authors have communicated to the curator that the species ought to have a constant value. There are a few other differences from the paper and these were made in consultation with the authors. Model was successfully tested on MathSBML.</p>
