    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <div class="bibo:abstract">
      <p>BACKGROUND: 24-hour biological clocks are intimately
    connected to the cellular signalling network, which complicates
    the analysis of clock mechanisms. The transcriptional regulator
    TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) is a founding component of
    the gene circuit in the plant circadian clock. Recent results
    show that TOC1 suppresses transcription of multiple target
    genes within the clock circuit, far beyond its
    previously-described regulation of the morning transcription
    factors LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) and CCA1 (CIRCADIAN
    CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1). It is unclear how this pervasive effect of
    TOC1 affects the dynamics of the clock and its outputs. TOC1
    also appears to function in a nested feedback loop that
    includes signalling by the plant hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA),
    which is upregulated by abiotic stresses, such as drought. ABA
    treatments both alter TOC1 levels and affect the clock&apos;s timing
    behaviour. Conversely, the clock rhythmically modulates
    physiological processes induced by ABA, such as the closing of
    stomata in the leaf epidermis. In order to understand the
    dynamics of the clock and its outputs under changing
    environmental conditions, the reciprocal interactions between
    the clock and other signalling pathways must be integrated.
    RESULTS: We extended the mathematical model of the plant clock
    gene circuit by incorporating the repression of multiple clock
    genes by TOC1, observed experimentally. The revised model more
    accurately matches the data on the clock&apos;s molecular profiles
    and timing behaviour, explaining the clock&apos;s responses in TOC1
    over-expression and toc1 mutant plants. A simplified
    representation of ABA signalling allowed us to investigate the
    interactions of ABA and circadian pathways. Increased ABA
    levels lengthen the free-running period of the clock,
    consistent with the experimental data. Adding stomatal closure
    to the model, as a key ABA- and clock-regulated downstream
    process allowed to describe TOC1 effects on the rhythmic gating
    of stomatal closure. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated model of the
    circadian clock circuit and ABA-regulated environmental sensing
    allowed us to explain multiple experimental observations on the
    timing and stomatal responses to genetic and environmental
    perturbations. These results crystallise a new role of TOC1 as
    an environmental sensor, which both affects the pace of the
    central oscillator and modulates the kinetics of downstream
    processes.</p>
