of weak centimetre electromagnetic waves

We formulate the dynamical model for the anti-tumour immune response based on
intercellular cytokine-mediated interactions with the interleukin-2 (IL-2) taken into
account. The analysis shows that the expression level of tumour antigens on antigen
presenting cells has a distinct influence on the tumour dynamics. At low antigen
presentation, a progressive tumour growth takes place to the highest possible value.
At high antigen presentation, there is a decrease in tumour size to some value when the
dynamical equilibrium between the tumour and the immune system is reached. In the
case of the medium antigen presentation, both these regimes can be realized depending
on the initial tumour size and the condition of the immune system. A pronounced
immunomodulating effect (the suppression of tumour growth and the normalization of
IL-2 concentration) is established by considering the influence of low-intensity
electromagnetic microwaves as a parametric perturbation of the dynamical system. This
finding is in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental results on
immunocorrective effects of centimetre electromagnetic waves in tumour-bearing mice.
